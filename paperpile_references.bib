              activity during the interval between a transient sensory stimulus

              cortical and subcortical areas. Such persistent activity is
              thought to reflect the maintenance of working memory

              that persistent activity observed broadly across many cortical
              and subcortical areas reflects not only working memory
              maintenance, but also a variety of other cognitive processes,

              the spatial patterns of brain activity in early visual cortex,
              how populations encode WM representations remains unclear. Here,
              we address this limitation by using a model-based approach that
              reconstructs the feature encoded by population activity measured
              with fMRI. Using this approach, we could successfully reconstruct
              the locations of memory-guided saccade goals based on the pattern
              of activity in visual cortex during a memory delay. We could
              reconstruct the saccade goal even when we dissociated the visual
              stimulus from the saccade goal using a memory-guided antisaccade
              procedure. By comparing the spatiotemporal population dynamics,
              we find that the representations in visual cortex are stable but
              can also evolve from a representation of a remembered visual
              stimulus to a prospective goal. Moreover, because the
              representation of the antisaccade goal cannot be the result of
              bottom-up visual stimulation, it must be evoked by top-down
              signals presumably originating from frontal and/or parietal
              cortex. Indeed, we find that trial-by-trial fluctuations in delay
              period activity in frontal and parietal cortex correlate with the
              precision with which our model reconstructed the maintained
              saccade goal based on the pattern of activity in visual cortex.
              Therefore, the population dynamics in visual cortex encode WM
              representations, and these representations can be sculpted by
              top-down signals from frontal and parietal cortex.",

               increasingly experiencing a state of information overload.
               Statistics show that we are interrupted every three minutes
               during the course of the work day. Multitasking between email,
               cell-phone, text messages, and four or five websites while
               listening to an iPod forces the brain to process more and more
               informaton at greater and greater speeds. And yet the human
               brain has hardly changed in the last 40,000 years.Are all these
               high-tech advances overtaxing our Stone Age brains or is the
               constant flood of information good for us, giving our brains the
               daily exercise they seem to crave? In The Overflowing Brain,
               cognitive scientist Torkel Klingberg takes us on a journey into
               the limits and possibilities of the brain. He suggests that we
               should acknowledge and embrace our desire for information and
               mental challenges, but try to find a balance between demand and
               capacity. Klingberg explores the cognitive demands, or
               ``complexity,'' of everyday life and how the brain tries to meet
               them. He identifies different types of attention, such as
               stimulus-driven and controlled attention, but focuses chiefly on
               ``working memory,'' our capacity to keep information in mind for
               short periods of time. Dr Klingberg asserts that working memory
               capacity, long thought to be static and hardwired in the brain,
               can be improved by training, and that the increasing demands on
               working memory may actually have a constructive effect: as
               demands on the human brain increase, so does its capacity.The
               book ends with a discussion of the future of brain development
               and how we can best handle information overload in our everyday
               lives. Klingberg suggests how we might find a balance between
               demand and capacity and move from feeling overwhelmed to deeply

              be summaried as follows. Humans know the uncertainty of their
              working memory and use it to make decisions; the content and the
              uncertainty of working memory can be decoded from BOLD signals;
              decoding errors predict memory errors at the single-trial level;
              decoded uncertainty correlates with behavioral reports of working
              memory uncertainty. It is not too surprising that the states of
              feature detector neurons obey a statistical distribution. It is
              however not obvious that the reliability of the memory should
              correlate with the width of this distribution and that even the
              subjective estimate for the reliability should reflect this
              width. If one accept the notion of quantum brain, the
              distribution of features could reflect the non-determinism of the
              outcome in the reduction of entanglement quantum measurements
              producing sensations. Zero energy ontology (ZEO) leads to the
              notion of 4-D brain and suggests that the feature ensemble is not
              spatial, as it should be in standard quantum theory, but a
              temporal ansemble formed by the memory mental images of feature.
              Quite generally, in ZEO sequences of ``small'' state function
              reductions (SSFRs) as counterparts of so called weak measurements

  author    = "Nguyen, Mai and Hermes, Dora and Winawer, Jonathan",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Elucidating the neural circuits underlying the BOLD
               signal measured with fMRI is an important goal in human
               neuroscience. One approach is to correlate the amplitude of the
               BOLD signal with the field potential power in different temporal
               frequency bands. However, distinct frequency bands do not always
               correspond to different neural circuits. In visual cortex, field
               potential power in the gamma band consists of at least two
               large, distinct signals arising from distinct neural circuits:
               an oscillatory (narrowband) component and an asynchronous
               (broadband) component. We propose that the oscillatory component
               measures neural synchrony, which is unrelated to BOLD amplitude,
               whereas the broadband component more closely measures the level
               of neural activity, which influences BOLD. METHODS:
               Electrocorticography (ECoG) responses to gratings and noise
               patterns were previously measured in two human subjects in
               V1-V3. Here we measured fMRI responses to the same stimuli. ECoG
               responses were separated into broadband and narrowband
               components; the two components were separately correlated with
               the fMRI response in corresponding cortical regions. RESULTS: In
               V1, the ECoG broadband amplitude was positively and strongly
               correlated with BOLD across stimuli. In contrast, narrowband
               gamma amplitude was unrelated to BOLD. In V2/V3, BOLD was again
               positively correlated with broadband ECoG and unrelated to
               narrowband gamma; in V2/V3, the degree of alpha band suppression
               was also predictive of BOLD. CONCLUSION: In visual cortex, the
               asynchronous broadband component of the field potential is most
               predictive of the BOLD signal. Narrowband gamma oscillations
               appear as large signals in the voltage measurement but are
               uncorrelated with fMRI. The BOLD signal is not caused by, and
               does not correlate with, a particular frequency band in the LFP.
               Rather, it is a function of the level of neural activity, which
               influences the LFP power in many frequency bands, and is best
               indexed by broadband field potentials. Meeting abstract

              near-optimal Bayesian inference in a wide variety of tasks,
              ranging from cue integration to decision making to motor control.
              This implies that neurons both represent probability
              distributions and combine those distributions according to a
              close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem
              that the high variability in the responses of cortical neurons
              would make it difficult to implement such optimal statistical
              inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this
              variability implies that populations of neurons automatically
              represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of
              code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we
              demonstrate that the Poisson-like variability observed in cortex
              reduces a broad class of Bayesian inference to simple linear
              combinations of populations of neural activity. These results
              hold for arbitrary probability distributions over the stimulus,
              for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and for realistic neuronal
              variability.",

              biases in the strength of visual representations. Recent evidence
              argues that, during spatial attention, these biases reflect
              nascent saccadic eye movement commands. We examined the
              functional interaction of saccade preparation and visual coding

              retinotopically corresponding sites within the FEF using currents
              below that needed to evoke saccades. The magnitude of the

              loss or sparing of certain performance abilities has been shown
              to be attributable to differences in the specific requirements of
              behavioral testing (e.g., spatial vs. non-spatial memoranda)
              along with differences in the specific locations of applied
              ablations (e.g., dorsal vs. ventral prefrontal cortex). Such
              findings, which have accumulated now for over a century, have led
              to widespread acceptance that the dorsolateral and ventrolateral

              activity. To address this fundamental issue, we imaged the human
              brain during maintenance of spatial locations and varied whether
              the memory-guided saccade was selected before or after the delay.
              An oculomotor delayed matching-to-sample task (match) was used to
              measure maintained motor intention because the direction of the
              forthcoming saccade was known throughout the delay. We used a
              nonmatching-to-sample task (nonmatch) in which the saccade was
              unpredictable to measure maintained spatial attention. Oculomotor
              areas were more active during match delays, and posterior
              parietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex were more active
              during nonmatch delays. Additionally, the fidelity of the memory

              One influential theory posits that neurons in the lateral
              prefrontal cortex (lPFC) store WM information via persistent
              activity. In this review, we critically evaluate recent findings
              that together indicate that this model of WM needs revision. We
              argue that sensory cortex, not the lPFC, maintains high-fidelity
              representations of WM content. By contrast, the lPFC
              simultaneously maintains representations of multiple goal-related
              variables that serve to bias stimulus-specific activity in
              sensory regions. This work highlights multiple neural mechanisms
              supporting WM, including temporally dynamic population coding in
              addition to persistent activity. These new insights focus the
              question on understanding how the mechanisms that underlie WM are

              magnetic resonance imaging to identify cortical areas with

              goal of testing if such activity represents visuospatial

              two spatial working memory tasks. During a memory-guided saccade
              (MGS) task, a location was maintained during a delay after which
              a saccade was generated to the remembered location. During a

  abstract = "The detection and segmentation of meaningful figures from their
              background is one of the primary functions of vision. While work
              in nonhuman primates has implicated early visual mechanisms in
              this figure-ground modulation, neuroimaging in humans has instead
              largely ascribed the processing of figures and objects to higher
              stages of the visual hierarchy. Here, we used high-field fMRI at
              7 Tesla to measure BOLD responses to task-irrelevant
              orientation-defined figures in human early visual cortex (N = 6,
              four females). We used a novel population receptive field
              mapping-based approach to resolve the spatial profiles of two
              constituent mechanisms of figure-ground modulation: a local
              boundary response, and a further enhancement spanning the full
              extent of the figure region that is driven by global differences
              in features. Reconstructing the distinct spatial profiles of
              these effects reveals that figure enhancement modulates responses
              in human early visual cortex in a manner consistent with a
              mechanism of automatic, contextually driven feedback from higher

              system is to parse complex 2D input into meaningful figures. We
              do so constantly and seamlessly, both by processing information
              about visible edges and by analyzing large-scale differences
              between figure and background. While influential neurophysiology
              work has characterized an intriguing mechanism that enhances V1
              responses to perceptual figures, we have a poor understanding of
              how the early visual system contributes to figure-ground
              processing in humans. Here, we use advanced computational
              analysis methods and high-field human fMRI data to resolve the
              distinct spatial profiles of local edge and global figure
              enhancement in the early visual system (V1 and LGN); the latter
              is distinct and consistent with a mechanism of automatic,

              psychiatric disorders, necessitating a caution in terms of
              interpreting research results. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at
              systematically evaluating a representative sample of research
              conducted using NIBS interventions in neuro-psychiatric
              conditions, and assessing the power these studies achieved, given
              their sample sizes. METHODS: A database search was conducted with
              defined keyword combinations. Using reported summary effects of
              the meta-analyses as estimate of the true effects, we calculated
              achieved power of each individual study to detect the effect
              indicated by the corresponding meta-analysis. RESULTS: Findings
              suggest that mean and median powers in the field of NIBS were
              0.50, with a mode at 0.83 (range 0.05-1.00). When analysed
              separately, the median powers were 0.27 for tDCS, 0.70 for TMS
              and 0.97 for ECT. These studies had a mean total sample size of
              22.2 $\pm$ 24.9 subjects and the median reported effect size
              across all studies was 0.61. CONCLUSION: According to our
              findings, studies conducted in NIBS miss around 50\% of true
              positive results. Further, it appears that most of the
              researchers in this field chase statistical significance with

               maps with each species having similar, but not identical, maps.
               The introduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging made
               it possible to identify visual field maps in human cortex,
               including several near (1) medial occipital (V1,V2,V3), (2)

               a post-implantation MRI is utilized for electrode detection

               using multiple methods, spanning a wide range of spatial and
               temporal resolutions. We investigated the relationship between
               electric field potentials measured with electrocorticography
               (ECoG) and the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response
               measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
               set out to explain the full set of measurements by modeling the
               underlying neural circuits. RESULTS: ECoG responses in visual
               cortex can be separated into two visually driven components. One
               component is a specific temporal response that follows each
               stimulus contrast reversal (``stimulus locked''); the other
               component is an increase in the response variance
               (``asynchronous''). For electrodes in visual cortex (V1, V2,
               V3), the two measures respond to stimuli in the same region of
               visual space, but they have different spatial summation
               properties. The stimulus-locked ECoG component sums contrast
               approximately linearly across space; spatial summation in the
               asynchronous ECoG component is subadditive. Spatial summation
               measured using BOLD closely matches the asynchronous component.
               We created a neural simulation that accurately captures the main
               features of the ECoG time series; in the simulation, the
               stimulus-locked and asynchronous components arise from different
               neural circuits. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that
               the two ECoG components arise from different neural sources
               within the same cortical region. The spatial summation
               measurements and simulations suggest that the BOLD response
               arises primarily from neural sources that generate the
               asynchronous broadband ECoG component.",

  abstract  = "It has been suggested that cross-frequency phase-amplitude
               coupling (PAC), particularly in temporal brain structures,
               serves as a neural mechanism for coordinated working memory
               storage. In this magnetoencephalography study, we show that
               during visual working memory maintenance, temporal cortex
               regions, which exhibit enhanced PAC, interact with prefrontal
               cortex via enhanced low-frequency phase synchronization. Healthy
               human participants were engaged in a visual delayed
               match-to-sample task with pictures of natural objects. During
               the delay period, we observed increased spectral power of beta
               (20-28 Hz) and gamma (40-94 Hz) bands as well as decreased power
               of theta/alpha band (7-9 Hz) oscillations in visual sensory
               areas. Enhanced PAC between the phases of theta/alpha and the
               amplitudes of beta oscillations was found in the left inferior
               temporal cortex (IT), an area known to be involved in visual
               object memory. Furthermore, the IT was functionally connected to
               the prefrontal cortex by increased low-frequency phase
               synchronization within the theta/alpha band. Together, these
               results point to a mechanism in which the combination of PAC and
               long-range phase synchronization subserves enhanced large-scale
               brain communication. They suggest that distant brain regions
               might coordinate their activity in the low-frequency range to
               engage local stimulus-related processing in higher frequencies
               via the combination of long-range, within-frequency phase
               synchronization and local cross-frequency PAC. SIGNIFICANCE
               STATEMENT: Working memory maintenance, like other cognitive
               functions, requires the coordinated engagement of brain areas in
               local and large-scale networks. However, the mechanisms by which
               spatially distributed brain regions share and combine
               information remain primarily unknown. We show that the
               combination of long-range, low-frequency phase synchronization
               and local cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling might serve
               as a mechanism to coordinate memory processes across distant
               brain areas. In this study, low-frequency phase synchronization
               between prefrontal and temporal cortex co-occurred with local
               cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling to higher frequencies
               in the latter. By such means, ongoing working memory storage
               taking place in higher frequencies in temporal regions might be
               effectively coordinated by distant frontal brain regions through
               synchronized activity in the low-frequency range.",

              exogenous attention on performance. Observers performed an
              orientation discrimination task. After a peripheral valid,

              presented, one in the stimulated region and the other in the

              two successive TMS pulses around their occipital pole while the

               cortical neurons were on average more strongly driven by the

               Understanding more accurately the volumetric differences in

  abstract = "The lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) is reliably active during
              working memory (WM) across human and animal models, but the role
              of lPFC in successful WM is under debate. For instance, non-human
              primate (NHP) electrophysiology research finds that lPFC
              circuitry stores WM representations. Human neuroimaging instead
              suggests that lPFC plays a control function over WM content that
              is stored in sensory cortices. These seemingly incompatible WM
              accounts are often confounded by differences in the amount of
              task training and stimulus exposure across studies (i.e., NHPs
              tend to be trained extensively). Here, we test the possibility
              that such long-term training may alter the role of lPFC in WM
              maintenance. We densely sampled WM-related activity across
              learning, in three human participants, using a longitudinal
              functional MRI (fMRI) protocol. Over three months, participants
              trained on (1) a serial reaction time (SRT) task, wherein complex
              fractal stimuli were embedded within probabilistic sequences, and
              (2) a delayed recognition task probing WM for trained or novel
              stimuli. Participants were scanned frequently throughout
              training, to track how WM activity patterns change with repeated
              stimulus exposure and long-term associative learning. WM task
              performance improved for trained (but not novel) fractals and,
              neurally, delay activity significantly increased in distributed
              lPFC voxels across learning. Pattern similarity analyses also
              found that item-level WM representations emerged within lPFC, but
              not in sensory cortices, and lPFC delay activity increasingly
              reflected sequence relationships from the SRT task, even though
              that information was task-irrelevant for WM. These findings
              demonstrate that human lPFC develops stimulus-selective WM
              responses with learning and WM representations are shaped by
              long-term experience. Influences from training and long-term

              cognitive abilities that substantially vary between individuals.
              Although much is known about how attentional control and working
              memory capacity relate to each other and to constructs like fluid
              intelligence, little is known about how trial-by-trial
              fluctuations in attentional engagement impact trial-by-trial
              working memory performance. Here, we employ a novel whole-report
              memory task that allowed us to distinguish between varying levels
              of attentional engagement in humans performing a working memory
              task. By characterizing low-performance trials, we can
              distinguish between models in which working memory performance
              failures are caused by either (1) complete lapses of attention or
              (2) variations in attentional control. We found that performance
              failures increase with set-size and strongly predict working
              memory capacity. Performance variability was best modeled by an
              attentional control model of attention, not a lapse model. We
              examined neural signatures of performance failures by measuring
              EEG activity while participants performed the whole-report task.
              The number of items correctly recalled in the memory task was
              predicted by frontal theta power, with decreased frontal theta
              power associated with poor performance on the task. In addition,
              we found that poor performance was not explained by failures of
              sensory encoding; the P1/N1 response and ocular artifact rates
              were equivalent for high- and low-performance trials. In all, we
              propose that attentional lapses alone cannot explain individual
              differences in working memory performance. Instead, we find that
              graded fluctuations in attentional control better explain the
              trial-by-trial differences in working memory that we observe.",

  abstract = "There is a consensus that visual working memory (WM) resources
              are sharply limited, but debate persists regarding the simple
              question of whether there is a limit to the total number of items
              that can be stored concurrently. Zhang and Luck (2008) advanced
              this debate with an analytic procedure that provided strong
              evidence for random guessing responses, but their findings can
              also be described by models that deny guessing while asserting a
              high prevalence of low precision memories. Here, we used a whole
              report memory procedure in which subjects reported all items in
              each trial and indicated whether they were guessing with each
              response. Critically, this procedure allowed us to measure memory
              performance for all items in each trial. When subjects were asked
              to remember 6 items, the response error distributions for about 3
              out of the 6 items were best fit by a parameter-free guessing
              model (i.e. a uniform distribution). In addition, subjects'
              self-reports of guessing precisely tracked the guessing rate
              estimated with a mixture model. Control experiments determined
              that guessing behavior was not due to output interference, and
              that there was still a high prevalence of guessing when subjects
              were instructed not to guess. Our novel approach yielded evidence
              that guesses, not low-precision representations, best explain
              limitations in working memory. These guesses also corroborate a
              capacity-limited working memory system - we found evidence that
              subjects are able to report non-zero information for only 3-4
              items. Thus, WM capacity is constrained by an item limit that
              precludes the storage of more than 3-4 individuated feature
              values.",

              mostly on whether mental images activate early sensory areas,
              with mixed results [5-7]. Recent studies suggest that
              multivariate pattern analysis of neural activity patterns in

              cognitive processes, even though overall activation levels are

              number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device
              than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that
              there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three
              to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide
              variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller
              capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in
              analyses of information processing only if the boundary
              conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four
              basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity
              limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information
              overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when
              other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of
              stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance
              discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various
              indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions,
              rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus
              items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms
              that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the
              capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall.
              A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is
              implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The
              pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from
              compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held
              chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall

              could better account for VWM performance, independent of load.
              Across 2 experiments, performance was better predicted by the
              prioritization of memory items (i.e., attention) than by the
              number of items to be remembered (i.e., memory load). This
              relationship followed a power law, and held regardless of whether
              performance was assessed based on overall precision or any of 3
              measures in a mixture model. Moreover, at large set sizes, even
              minimally attended items could receive a small proportion of
              resources, without any evidence for a discrete-capacity on the

  abstract = "Working memory (WM) is a system for the online storage of
              information. An emerging view is that neuronal oscillations
              coordinate the cellular assemblies that code the content of WM.
              In line with this view, previous work has demonstrated that
              oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) plays a role in
              WM maintenance, but the exact contributions of this activity have
              remained unclear. Here, we used an inverted spatial encoding
              model in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) to test
              whether the topographic distribution of alpha-band activity
              tracks spatial representations held in WM. Participants in three
              experiments performed spatial WM tasks that required them to
              remember the precise angular location of a sample stimulus for
              1,000-1,750 ms. Across all three experiments, we found that the
              topographic distribution of alpha-band activity tracked the
              specific location that was held in WM. Evoked (i.e., activity
              phase-locked to stimulus onset) and total (i.e., activity
              regardless of phase) power across a range of low-frequency bands
              transiently tracked the location of the sample stimulus following
              stimulus onset. However, only total power in the alpha band
              tracked the content of spatial WM throughout the memory delay
              period, which enabled reconstruction of location-selective
              channel tuning functions (CTFs). These findings demonstrate that
              alpha-band activity is directly related to the coding of spatial
              representations held in WM and provide a promising method for
              tracking the content of this online memory system.",

  abstract = "1. An oculomotor delayed-response task was used to examine the
              spatial memory functions of neurons in primate prefrontal cortex.
              Monkeys were trained to fixate a central spot during a brief
              presentation (0.5 s) of a peripheral cue and throughout a
              subsequent delay period (1-6 s), and then, upon the extinction of
              the fixation target, to make a saccadic eye movement to where the
              cue had been presented. Cues were usually presented in one of
              eight different locations separated by 45 degrees. This task thus
              requires monkeys to direct their gaze to the location of a
              remembered visual cue, controls the retinal coordinates of the
              visual cues, controls the monkey's oculomotor behavior during the
              delay period, and also allows precise measurement of the timing
              and direction of the relevant behavioral responses. 2. Recordings
              were obtained from 288 neurons in the prefrontal cortex within
              and surrounding the principal sulcus (PS) while monkeys performed
              this task. An additional 31 neurons in the frontal eye fields
              (FEF) region within and near the anterior bank of the arcuate
              sulcus were also studied. 3. Of the 288 PS neurons, 170 exhibited
              task-related activity during at least one phase of this task and,
              of these, 87 showed significant excitation or inhibition of
              activity during the delay period relative to activity during the
              intertrial interval. 4. Delay period activity was classified as
              directional for 79\% of these 87 neurons in that significant
              responses only occurred following cues located over a certain
              range of visual field directions and were weak or absent for
              other cue directions. The remaining 21\% were omnidirectional,
              i.e., showed comparable delay period activity for all visual
              field locations tested. Directional preferences, or lack thereof,
              were maintained across different delay intervals (1-6 s). 5. For
              50 of the 87 PS neurons, activity during the delay period was
              significantly elevated above the neuron's spontaneous rate for at
              least one cue location; for the remaining 37 neurons only
              inhibitory delay period activity was seen. Nearly all (92\%)
              neurons with excitatory delay period activity were directional
              and few (8\%) were omnidirectional. Most (62\%) neurons with
              purely inhibitory delay period activity were directional, but a
              substantial minority (38\%) was omnidirectional. 6. Fifteen of
              the neurons with excitatory directional delay period activity
              also had significant inhibitory delay period activity for other
              cue directions. These inhibitory responses were usually strongest
              for, or centered about, cue directions roughly opposite those
              optimal for excitatory responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

              reliably across individuals and across species. Similar
              strategies for parcellating higher-order cortex have proven
              elusive. Here, using a novel experimental task and nonlinear

              angle and eccentricity that are organized into clusters, similar
              to visual cortex, where multiple gradients of polar angle of the
              contralateral visual field share a confluent fovea. This is
              striking because neural activity in frontoparietal cortex is
              believed to reflect higher-order cognitive functions rather than
              external sensory processing. Perhaps the spatial topography in
              frontoparietal cortex parallels the retinotopic organization of
              sensory cortex to enable an efficient interface between
              perception and higher-order cognitive processes. Critically,

              brain activity in various cognitive tasks. This is typically done
              by characterizing event-related potentials/fields or modulations
              of oscillatory activity (e.g., event-related synchronization) in
              response to cognitively relevant stimuli. Here, we provide a link
              between the two phenomena. An essential component of our theory
              is that peaks and troughs of oscillatory activity fluctuate
              asymmetrically; e.g., peaks are more strongly modulated than
              troughs in response to stimuli. As a consequence, oscillatory
              brain activity will not ``average out'' when multiple trials are
              averaged. Using MEG, we demonstrate that such asymmetric
              amplitude fluctuations of the oscillatory alpha rhythm explain
              the generation of slow event-related fields. Furthermore, we
              provide a physiological explanation for the observed asymmetric
              amplitude fluctuations. In particular, slow event-related
              components are modulated by a wide range of cognitive tasks.

  abstract = "Previous studies from our laboratory identified a parietal eye
              field in the primate lateral intraparietal sulcus, the lateral
              intraparietal area (area LIP). Here we further explore the role
              of area LIP in processing saccadic eye movements by observing the
              effects of reversible inactivation of this area. One to 2 microl
              of muscimol (8 mg/ml) were injected at locations where
              saccade-related activities were recorded for each lesion
              experiment. After the muscimol injection we observed in two
              macaque monkeys consistent effects on both the metrics and
              dynamics of saccadic eye movements at many injection sites. These
              effects usually took place within 10-30 min and disappeared after
              5-6 h in most cases and certainly when tested the next day. After
              muscimol injection memory saccades directed toward the
              contralesional and upper space became hypometric, and in one
              monkey those to the ipsilesional space were slightly but
              significantly hypermetric. In some cases, the scatter of the end
              points of memory saccades was also increased. On the other hand,
              the metrics of visual saccades remained relatively intact.
              Latency for both visual and memory saccades toward the
              contralesional space was increased and in many cases displayed a
              higher variance after muscimol lesion. At many injection sites we
              also observed an increase of latency for visual and memory
              saccades toward the upper space. The peak velocities for memory
              saccades toward the contralesional space were decreased after
              muscimol injection. The peak velocities of visual saccades were
              not significantly different from those of the controls. The
              duration of saccadic eye movements either to the ipsilesional or
              contralesional space remained relatively the same for both visual
              and memory saccades. Overall these results demonstrated that we
              were able to selectively inactivate area LIP and observe effects
              on saccadic eye movements. Together with our previous recording
              studies these results futher support the view that area LIP plays
              a direct role in processing incoming sensory information to
              program saccadic eye movements. The results are consistent with
              our unit recording data and microstimulation studies, which
              suggest that area LIP represents contralateral space and also has
              a bias for the upper visual field.",

               peripheral visual cues, while maintaining fixation on a central
               visual target during the presentation of each cue and during a
               subsequent 1.5-8 sec delay period. Four rhesus monkeys received
               unilateral or serial prefrontal lesions in and around the
               principal sulcus after they reached criterion performance on the
               ODR tasks. Unilateral lesions disrupted the performance of
               memory-guided eye movements to spatial cues in the visual field
               contralateral to the hemisphere in which the lesion was placed.
               Memory-guided eye movements to ipsilateral cues were mildly
               affected by unilateral lesions, and these lesions had little or
               no effect on performance in visually guided control tasks. With
               addition of a second lesion in the opposite hemisphere, the
               deficit was extended to include the opposite hemifield. The
               impairment was characterized by eye movements of inappropriate
               direction, and, excepting the one lesion that extended into the
               frontal eye field region of the arcuate sulcus, saccadic
               reaction times and velocities were the same before and after the

               performance was rarely altered at the shortest (1.5 sec) delay

               caused by failure to maintain a transient memory ``trace'' in
               working memory, and indicate for the first time that working
               memory mechanisms are lateralized: memories for visuo-spatial
               coordinates in each hemifield are processed primarily in the
               contralateral prefrontal cortex. These findings provide evidence

               the human medial temporal lobe phase lock to ongoing
               slow-frequency (1-7 Hz) oscillations during WM maintenance. The
               properties of phase locking are dependent on memory content and
               load. During high memory loads, the phase of the oscillatory
               activity to which neurons phase lock provides information about
               memory content not available in the firing rate of the neurons.
               We provide a computational model that reveals that
               inhibitory-feedback-mediated competition between multiple
               persistently active neurons reproduces this phenomenon. This
               work reveals a mechanism for the active maintenance of multiple
               items in WM that relies on persistently active neurons whose
               activation is orchestrated by oscillatory activity.",

               presented gratings, one in each quadrant of the visual field. A
               10Hz Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) triplet was applied
               directly at stimulus offset, or midway through a 2-second delay,
               targeting early visual cortex corresponding retinotopically to a
               sample item in the lower hemifield. Memory for one of the four
               gratings was probed at random, and participants reported this
               orientation via method of adjustment. Recall errors were smaller
               when the visual field location targeted by TMS overlapped with
               that of the cued memory item, compared to errors for stimuli
               probed diagonally to TMS. This implied topographic storage of

               targeted location. Furthermore, early pulses impaired
               performance at all four locations, compared to late pulses.
               Next, response errors were fit empirically using a mixture model

              load, reaches an asymptote at known behavioral limits, and
              predicts individual differences in capacity. An open question,
              however, is whether neural measures of load also track
              trial-by-trial fluctuations in performance. Here, we used a

              CDA amplitude and working memory performance. If working memory
              failures are due to decision-based errors and retrieval failures,
              CDA amplitude would not differentiate good and poor performance
              trials when load is held constant. If failures arise during
              storage, then CDA amplitude should track both working memory load
              and trial-by-trial performance. As expected, CDA amplitude
              tracked load (Experiment 1), reaching an asymptote at three
              items. In Experiment 2, we tracked fluctuations in trial-by-trial
              performance. CDA amplitude was larger (more negative) for
              high-performance trials compared with low-performance trials,
              suggesting that fluctuations in performance were related to the

               high-frequency oscillations that are phase-coupled to a
               low-frequency spatially distributed coupling oscillation. This

               data, we provide evidence for multiple oscillatory patterns, as
               characterized on the basis of their spatial maps (topographies)

               maps for the coupling oscillations are much more widespread than
               the ones for the associated phase-coupled bursts. Second, in the

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the stability of visual phosphene
               thresholds and to assess whether they correlate with motor
               thresholds. BACKGROUND: Currently, motor threshold is used as an
               index of cortical sensitivity so that in transcranial magnetic
               stimulation (TMS) experiments, intensity can be set at a given
               percentage of this value. It is not known whether this is a
               reasonable index of cortical sensitivity in non-motor and hence
               whether it should be used in experiments where other cortical
               areas are targeted. Previous studies have indicated that
               phosphene threshold might be a suitable alternative in TMS
               studies of the visual system. METHOD: Using single pulse TMS
               visual phosphene and motor thresholds were measured in 15
               subjects. Both thresholds were retested in seven of these
               subjects a week later. RESULT: Visual phosphene thresholds,
               though stable within subjects across the two sessions, showed
               greater variability than motor thresholds. There was no
               correlation between the two measures. CONCLUSION: TMS motor
               thresholds cannot be assumed to be a guide to visual cortex
               excitability and by extension are probably an inappropriate
               guide to the cortical excitability of other non-motor areas of
               the brain. Phosphene thresholds are proposed as a potential
               standard for inter-individual comparison in visual TMS

              communication between brain regions. For this to occur, such

              that also demonstrate time-locked correlations, with time delays
              that match the phase delays of the coherent oscillations. Here,
              by analyzing functional connectivity in both the time and
              frequency domains, we demonstrate that alpha oscillations satisfy
              these constraints and are well suited for modulating
              communication over large spatial scales in the human brain. We
              examine intracranial EEG in the human temporal lobe and find
              robust alpha oscillations that are coherent between brain regions
              with center frequencies that are consistent within each
              individual participant. Regions demonstrating coherent narrowband

              placement considering experimental parameters such as the
              subject's hair thickness and coil placement restrictions. The
              coil placement optimization is implemented in SimNIBS 3.2, for
              which an additional graphical user interface (TargetingNavigator)
              is provided to visualize/adjust procedural parameters. The coil
              optimization process also computes the E-field at the target,
              allowing the selection of the TMS device intensity setting to
              achieve specific E-field strengths. The optimized coil placement

              results TAP was demonstrated in a study consisting of three
              repetitive TMS sessions in five subjects. TMS was delivered by an
              experienced operator under neuronavigation with the
              computationally optimized coil placement. Analysis of the
              experimental accuracy from the recorded neuronavigation data
              indicated coil location and orientation deviations up to about 2
              mm and 2°, respectively, resulting in an 8\% median decrease in
              the target E-field magnitude compared to the optimal placement.
              Significance TAP supports navigated TMS with a variety of
              features for rigorous and reproducible stimulation delivery,
              including planning and evaluation of coil placement and intensity

              generalizes to other sensory modalities is a topic of ongoing
              scientific debate. Here, we designed an auditory paradigm
              eliminating any visual input in which participants were required
              to attend to upcoming sounds from one of 24 loudspeakers arranged
              in a horizontal circular array around the head. Maintaining the
              location of an auditory cue was associated with a topographically
              modulated distribution of posterior alpha power resembling the
              findings known from visual attention. Alpha power modulations in

              this prediction was still possible, albeit weaker, when derived
              from the horizontal electrooculogram capturing saccadic behavior.
              We conclude that attending to an auditory target engages

  abstract = "Working-memory tasks often lead to elevated delay-period
              discharge rates in cortical neurons. When this altered neuronal
              discharge rate, called delay activity, shows stimulus
              specificity, it is a good candidate for a neuronal mechanism of
              working memory. If the delay activity is indeed the carrier of
              memory, then experimental manipulation during the delay period
              that disrupts delay activity should also disrupt behavioral
              performance. We tested this hypothesis in two macaque monkeys
              with a delayed matching-to-sample task (delay time: 8 or 10 s) in
              which only two visual images were used. In each trial, one of the
              images was randomly chosen as the sample. In control trials
              (without disruptive stimulation), the monkeys performed at the
              level of 74.3\% correct recognition. Three electrical stimulation
              levels (mild: a 0.25-s train of electrical pulses; medium: 1-s
              train; strong: 4 s), delivered to the hippocampal formation or to
              the orbito-frontal and inferotemporal cortices during delay
              period, decreased the performance to 71.4, 66.8, and 58.0\%
              respectively (all are significantly less than control
              performance, P < 0.05 for mild stimulation and P < 0.0001 for
              other stimulation levels). Three hundred and thirty-four cells
              were recorded from inferotemporal (211 cells) and prefrontal (123
              cells) cortices. Significant (P < 0.05) stimulus-specific delay

              delay-period spike rates between preferred and nonpreferred
              images was 26\%. The electrical stimulation reduced this
              difference to 20\% (not a statistically significant reduction) in
              trials with mild stimulation, to 14\% (P < 0.05) with medium
              stimulation, and just to 4\% (P < 0.0005) with strong

              stimulation reduced neuronal selectivity and at the same time

              neuronal information transfer and retention. Phases along the
              theta cycle represent varied excitability states, whereby
              high-excitability states correspond to high-frequency neuronal

              demonstrated in animal studies. Human studies corroborate this
              model and suggest a core role of prefrontal theta activity in
              working memory (WM). OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed at modulating
              prefrontal neuronal excitability and WM performance in healthy
              humans, using real-time EEG analysis for triggering repetitive
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) theta-phase synchronized
              to the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. METHODS: 16 subjects
              underwent 3 different rTMS interventions on separate days, with
              pulses triggered according to the individual's real-time EEG
              activity: 400 rTMS gamma-frequency (100 Hz) triplet bursts
              applied during either the negative peak of the prefrontal theta
              oscillation, the positive peak, or at random phase. Changes in
              cortical excitability were assessed with EEG responses following
              single-pulse TMS, and behavioral effects by using a WM task.
              RESULTS: Negative-peak rTMS increased single-pulse TMS-induced
              prefrontal theta power and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling,
              and decreased WM response time. In contrast, positive-peak rTMS

              memory functions. In this review, we provide an exhaustive
              overview of these studies and ascertain how well the available

              memory retention and retrieval. We discuss the validity and

              theoretical criteria that are relevant for brain stimulation of
              visual cortex. While most studies applied TMS to visual cortex to
              interfere with memory functions, a handful of pioneering studies
              used TMS to 'reactivate' memories in visual cortex.
              Interestingly, similar effects of TMS on memory were found in
              different memory tasks, which suggests that different memory
              systems share a neural mechanism of memory in visual cortex. At
              the same time, this neural mechanism likely interacts with higher
              order brain areas. Based on this overview and evaluation, we
              provide a first attempt to an integrative framework that

              Here we investigated whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
              (TMS) can reveal the content of visual short-term memory (VSTM)
              by bringing this information to visual awareness. Subjects were
              presented with two random-dot displays (moving either to the left
              or to the right) and they were required to maintain one of these
              in VSTM. In Experiment 1, TMS was applied over the
              motion-selective area V5/MT+ above phosphene threshold during the
              maintenance phase. The reported phosphene contained motion
              features of the memory item, when the phosphene spatially
              overlapped with memory item. Specifically, phosphene motion was
              enhanced when the memory item moved in the same direction as the
              subjects' V5/MT+ baseline phosphene, whereas it was reduced when
              the motion direction of the memory item was incongruent with that
              of the baseline V5/MT+ phosphene. There was no effect on
              phosphene reports when there was no spatial overlap between the
              phosphene and the memory item. In Experiment 2, VSTM maintenance
              did not influence the appearance of phosphenes induced from the

              maintenance and phosphene appearance demonstrate that activity in
              V5/MT+ reflects the motion qualities of items maintained in VSTM.
              Furthermore, these results also demonstrate that information in
              VSTM can modulate the pattern of visual activation reaching

              support for the view that the stimulation of several different
              visual areas in the occipital lobe may produce phosphenes, it is
              not clear what the contribution of each area is. Here, we studied
              the roles of the primary visual cortex (V1) and the adjacent area

              imaging-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined

              Reports of the subjective visual features of phosphenes were

              stimulation of V1 and V2 are equally capable of generating

              Nevertheless, V1 and V2 contribute differently to brightness:
              neural activation originating in V1 generates a more intense

              retention period. The negative slow wave (NSW) and contralateral
              delay activity (CDA) are event-related potentials in the EEG
              signal that are commonly used in change detection tasks to track
              working memory load, as both increase with the number of items
              maintained in working memory (set size). While the CDA was argued

              the NSW, it also requires a lateralized design and attention
              shifts prior to memoranda onset, imposing more restrictions on
              the task than the NSW. The present study proposes a novel change
              detection task in which both CDA and NSW can be measured at the

              distribution in the left and right hemifield varied, inducing a

              associations between inter-individual differences in brain
              structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health
              phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS
              have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical
              brain mapping4 (the median neuroimaging study sample size is
              about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible
              brain-behavioural phenotype associations5,6. Here we used three
              of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available-with a
              total sample size of around 50,000 individuals-to quantify BWAS
              effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size.
              BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting

  title    = "The Human Brain Encodes a Chronicle of Visual Events at Each
              Instant of Time Through the Multiplexing of Traveling Waves",
  author   = "King, Jean-R{\'e}mi and Wyart, Valentin",
  abstract = "The human brain continuously processes streams of visual input.
              Yet, a single image typically triggers neural responses that
              extend beyond 1s. To understand how the brain encodes and
              maintains successive images, we analyzed with
              electroencephalography the brain activity of human subjects while
              they watched ∼5000 visual stimuli presented in fast sequences.
              First, we confirm that each stimulus can be decoded from brain
              activity for ∼1s, and we demonstrate that the brain
              simultaneously represents multiple images at each time instant.
              Second, we source localize the corresponding brain responses in
              the expected visual hierarchy and show that distinct brain
              regions represent, at each time instant, different snapshots of
              past stimulations. Third, we propose a simple framework to
              further characterize the dynamical system of these traveling
              waves. Our results show that a chain of neural circuits, which
              each consist of (1) a hidden maintenance mechanism and (2) an
              observable update mechanism, accounts for the dynamics of
              macroscopic brain representations elicited by visual sequences.
              Together, these results detail a simple architecture explaining
              how successive visual events and their respective timings can be
              simultaneously represented in the brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              Our retinas are continuously bombarded with a rich flux of visual
              input. Yet, how our brain continuously processes such visual
              streams is a major challenge to neuroscience. Here, we developed
              techniques to decode and track, from human brain activity,
              multiple images flashed in rapid succession. Our results show
              that the brain simultaneously represents multiple successive
              images at each time instant by multiplexing them along a neural
              cascade. Dynamical modeling shows that these results can be
              explained by a hierarchy of neural assemblies that continuously
              propagate multiple visual contents. Overall, this study sheds new
              light on the biological basis of our visual experience.",

  abstract = "Working memory (WM) activity is not as stationary or sustained as
              previously thought. There are brief bursts of gamma (~50-120 Hz)
              and beta (~20-35 Hz) oscillations, the former linked to stimulus
              information in spiking. We examined these dynamics in relation to
              readout and control mechanisms of WM. Monkeys held sequences of
              two objects in WM to match to subsequent sequences. Changes in
              beta and gamma bursting suggested their distinct roles. In
              anticipation of having to use an object for the match decision,
              there was an increase in gamma and spiking information about that
              object and reduced beta bursting. This readout signal was only
              seen before relevant test objects, and was related to premotor
              activity. When the objects were no longer needed, beta increased
              and gamma decreased together with object spiking information.
              Deviations from these dynamics predicted behavioral errors. Thus,
              beta could regulate gamma and the information in WM.",

  author   = "Lakatos, Peter and Gross, Joachim and Thut, Gregor",
  abstract = "Rhythms are a fundamental and defining feature of neuronal
              activity in animals including humans. This rhythmic brain
              activity interacts in complex ways with rhythms in the internal
              and external environment through the phenomenon of 'neuronal
              entrainment', which is attracting increasing attention due to its
              suggested role in a multitude of sensory and cognitive processes.
              Some senses, such as touch and vision, sample the environment
              rhythmically, while others, like audition, are faced with mostly
              rhythmic inputs. Entrainment couples rhythmic brain activity to
              external and internal rhythmic events, serving fine-grained
              routing and modulation of external and internal signals across
              multiple spatial and temporal hierarchies. This interaction
              between a brain and its environment can be experimentally
              investigated and even modified by rhythmic sensory stimuli or
              invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques. We provide
              a comprehensive overview of the topic and propose a theoretical
              framework of how neuronal entrainment dynamically structures
              information from incoming neuronal, bodily and environmental
              sources. We discuss the different types of neuronal entrainment,
              the conceptual advances in the field, and converging evidence for

               synchrony of intrinsic alpha rhythms in the occipital cortex can
               be entrained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an
               open question. We applied 4-pulse, 10-Hz rhythmic TMS to entrain
               intrinsic alpha oscillators targeting right V1/V2, and tested
               four predictions with concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG): (1)
               progressive enhancement of entrainment across time windows, (2)
               output frequency specificity, (3) dependence on the intrinsic
               oscillation phase, and (4) input frequency specificity to
               individual alpha frequency (IAF) in the neural signatures. Two
               control conditions with an equal number of pulses and duration
               were arrhythmic-active and rhythmic-sham stimulation. The
               results confirmed the first three predictions. Rhythmic TMS
               bursts significantly entrained local neural activity. Near the
               stimulation site, evoked oscillation amplitude and inter-trial
               phase coherence (ITPC) were increased for 2 and 3 cycles,
               respectively, after the last TMS pulse. Critically, ITPC
               following entrainment positively correlated with IAF rather than
               with the degree of similarity between IAF and the input
               frequency (10 Hz). Thus, we entrained alpha-band activity in
               occipital cortex for ~ 3 cycles (~ 300 ms), and IAF predicts the

              monkey neurophysiology studies. Contrary to the prevalent view,
              the available evidence provides little support for the sensory
              account of VWM storage. Instead, when the ability to resist
              distraction and the existence of top-down feedback are taken into
              account, VWM-related activities in sensory areas seem to reflect
              feedback signals indicative of VWM storage elsewhere in the
              brain. Collectively, the evidence shows that prefrontal and
