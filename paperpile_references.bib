              mechanism underlying working memory, but recent proposals argue
              for alternative 'activity-silent' substrates. Using monkey and
              human electrophysiology data, we show here that attractor
              dynamics that control neural spiking during mnemonic periods
              interact with activity-silent mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex
              (PFC). This interaction allows memory reactivations, which
              enhance serial biases in spatial working memory. Stimulus
              information was not decodable between trials, but remained
              present in activity-silent traces inferred from spiking synchrony
              in the PFC. Just before the new stimulus, this latent trace was
              reignited into activity that recapitulated the previous stimulus
              representation. Importantly, the reactivation strength correlated
              with the strength of serial biases in both monkeys and humans, as
              predicted by a computational model that integrates activity-based
              and activity-silent mechanisms. Finally, single-pulse
              transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the human PFC
              between successive trials enhanced serial biases, thus
              demonstrating the causal role of prefrontal reactivations in
              determining working-memory behavior.",

              sensory convergence can occur in primary sensory cortex. A good

              which can be modulated by visual and tactile stimulation;
              however, given the large number and small size of auditory
              fields, neither human imaging nor microelectrode recordings have
              systematically identified which fields are susceptible to
              multisensory influences. To reconcile findings from human imaging

              high-resolution imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging)

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Brain processes of working memory involve
              oscillatory activities at multiple frequencies in local and
              long-range neural networks. The current study addressed the
              specific roles of alpha oscillations during memory encoding and
              retention, supporting the hypothesis that multiple functional
              mechanisms of alpha oscillations exist in parallel. METHOD: We
              recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 25 healthy young adults,
              who performed a variant of a Sternberg working memory task. A
              sequential list of five consonant letters was visually presented
              and was followed after a 2.0 s retention interval by a probe of a
              pair of two letters from the study list. Participants responded
              whether the probe pair was in same or reversed order in the list.
              RESULT: Reaction time (RT) was shortest for the first letters in
              the list, increased with increasing serial position, and shorter
              for the last position. RT was substantially longer for the probe
              in reversed order. Time-frequency analysis of the MEG revealed
              event-related desynchronization (ERD) of alpha oscillations
              during the encoding interval and an alpha power increase (ERS)
              during memory retention. Alpha ERD during encoding occurred at 10
              Hz and ERS during retention at 12 Hz, suggesting different alpha
              mechanisms. Analysis of alpha coherence and alpha-gamma
              cross-spectral coupling, applied to MEG beamformer source
              activity, revealed connectivity across brain areas. Additionally,
              alpha-gamma coupling identified centers of local computation. The
              connectivity between occipital and frontotemporal areas was
              correlated with alpha ERS during memory retention.
              Cross-frequency coupling between alpha phase and gamma amplitude
              depicted a hierarchy of information flow from frontal to temporal
              and occipital brain areas. CONCLUSION: Alpha decrease during
              encoding indicates an active state of visual processing, while
              subsequent ERS indicates inhibition of further visual input for
              protecting the memory, and phasic timing of temporal and
              occipital gamma oscillations is related to a long-range working
              memory networks.",

              coordinates of effectors, such as the eye, head, or hand. The
              transformation is accomplished by dynamic updating of spatial
              representations in conjunction with voluntary movements. This
              direct sensory-to-motor coordinate transformation obviates the
              need for a single representation of space in environmental
              coordinates. In addition to representing object locations in
              motoric coordinates, parietal neurons exhibit strong modulation
              by attention. Both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of attention
              contribute to the enhancement of visual responses. The saliance
              of a stimulus is the primary factor in determining the neural
              response to it. Although parietal neurons represent objects in
              motor coordinates, visual responses are independent of the
              intention to perform specific motor acts.",

              performance and how it provides novel insights into the
              mechanisms of each operation. Visual information must first be
              encoded into working memory with sufficient precision. The depth
              of this encoding process couples to arousal-linked baseline pupil
              size as well as a pupil constriction response before and after
              stimulus onset, respectively. Subsequently, the encoded
              information is maintained over time to ensure it is not lost.
              Pupil dilation reflects the effortful maintenance of information,
              wherein storing more items is accompanied by larger dilations.
              Lastly, the most task-relevant information is prioritized to
              guide upcoming behavior, which is reflected in yet another
              dilatory component. Moreover, activated content in memory can be
              pupillometrically probed directly by tagging visual information
              with distinct luminance levels. Through this luminance-tagging
              mechanism, pupil light responses reveal whether dark or bright
              items receive more attention during encoding and prioritization.
              Together, conceptualizing pupil responses as a sum of distinct
              components over time reveals insights into operations of visual
              working memory. From this viewpoint, pupillometry is a promising
              avenue to study the most vital operations through which visual

              achieve robust working memory maintenance is by having multiple
              concurrent mnemonic representations across multiple cortical
              loci. For example, early visual cortex might contribute to
              storage by representing information in a ``sensory-like'' format,
              while intraparietal sulcus uses a format transformed away from
              sensory driven responses. As an explicit test of mnemonic code
              transformations along the visual hierarchy, we quantitatively
              modeled the progression of veridical-to-categorical orientation
              representations in human participants. Participants directly
              viewed, or held in mind, an oriented grating pattern, and the
              similarity between fMRI activation patterns for different
              orientations was calculated throughout retinotopic cortex. During
              direct perception, similarity was clustered around cardinal
              orientations, while during working memory the obliques were
              represented more similarly. We modeled these similarity patterns
              based on the known distribution of orientation information in the
              natural world: The ``veridical'' model uses an efficient coding
              framework to capture hypothesized representations during visual
              perception. The ``categorical'' model assumes that different
              ``psychological distances'' between orientations result in
              orientation categorization relative to cardinal axes. During

              early visual areas, while the categorical model did worse. During
              working memory, the veridical model only explained some of the
              data, while the categorical model gradually gained explanatory
              power for increasingly anterior retinotopic regions. These
              findings suggest that directly viewed images are represented
              veridically, but once visual information is no longer tethered to
              the sensory world, there is a gradual progression to more
              categorical mnemonic formats along the visual hierarchy.",

              distractor suppression induced by spatial cues and its influence

              changes in the spatial proximity of the distractor: Cueing

              for the target, while cueing distractors close to the target

              thought to subserve gating of information processing in the human
              brain. While most of the supporting evidence is correlational,
              causal evidence comes from attempts to externally drive
              (``entrain'') these oscillations by transcranial magnetic
              stimulation (TMS). Indeed, the frequency profile of TMS-evoked
              potentials (TEPs) closely resembles that of oscillations
              spontaneously emerging in the same brain region. However, it is
              unclear whether TMS-locked and spontaneous oscillations are
              produced by the same neuronal mechanisms. If so, they should
              react in a similar manner to top-down modulation by endogenous
              attention. To test this prediction, we assessed the alpha-like
              EEG response to TMS of the visual cortex during periods of high
              and low visual attention while participants attended to either
              the visual or auditory modality in a cross-modal attention task.
              We observed a TMS-locked local oscillatory alpha response lasting
              several cycles after TMS (but not after sham stimulation).
              Importantly, TMS-locked alpha power was suppressed during
              deployment of visual relative to auditory attention, mirroring
              spontaneous alpha amplitudes. In addition, the early N40 TEP
              component, located at the stimulation site, was amplified by
              visual attention. The extent of attentional modulation for both
              TMS-locked alpha power and N40 amplitude did depend, with
              opposite sign, on the individual ability to modulate spontaneous
              alpha power at the stimulation site. We therefore argue that
              TMS-locked and spontaneous oscillations are of common
              neurophysiological origin, whereas the N40 TEP component may
              serve as an index of current cortical excitability at the time of

              young and aged male mice. Both LH and testosterone were measured
              in the same samples of blood plasma withdrawn at frequent
              intervals over 9 h from awake, mobile mice through intra-atrial
              cannulae. The results demonstrate unequivocally that LH and
              testosterone are discharged into the circulation in discontinuous
              pulses in this important animal model. Robust episodes of LH
              release occur at infrequent intervals and increments of
              circulating LH occasion time-delayed elevations of plasma
              testosterone. Thus, the frequency of LH release is the major
              factor determining peripheral concentrations of this
              gonadotropins. The obvious one-to-one coupling between
              intermittent LH discharges and testosterone secretion has
              significant functional and investigative implications. The
              reduction in circulating testosterone concentrations observed in
              old male mice is a consequence of fewer LH discharges, which is
              due most likely to the slowing of a neural GnRH pulse generator.
              However, age-related declines in copulatory behavior were not
              associated with altered patterns of hormone secretion. Hence, we
              suggest that deficits in sexual behavior and episodic LH release

              TMS were greatly reduced or entirely absent within 200 msec of
              stimulus offset. However, there was a reduction in swap rate

              prefrontal cortex, especially with regard to working memory. The
              loss or sparing of certain performance abilities has been shown
              to be attributable to differences in the specific requirements of
              behavioral testing (e.g., spatial vs. non-spatial memoranda)
              along with differences in the specific locations of applied
              ablations (e.g., dorsal vs. ventral prefrontal cortex). Such
              findings, which have accumulated now for over a century, have led
              to widespread acceptance that the dorsolateral and ventrolateral
              aspects of the prefrontal cortex may perform different,
              specialized roles in higher order cognition. Nonetheless, it
              remains unclear and controversial how the lateral prefrontal

              different types of functional specialization of the dorsal and

              prefrontal cortex is segregated according to the processing of
              spatial and nonspatial domains of information. The second
              contends that domain specialization is not the key to the

              dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortices perform qualitatively

              brain during maintenance of spatial locations and varied whether
              the memory-guided saccade was selected before or after the delay.
              An oculomotor delayed matching-to-sample task (match) was used to
              measure maintained motor intention because the direction of the
              forthcoming saccade was known throughout the delay. We used a
              nonmatching-to-sample task (nonmatch) in which the saccade was
              unpredictable to measure maintained spatial attention. Oculomotor
              areas were more active during match delays, and posterior
              parietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex were more active
              during nonmatch delays. Additionally, the fidelity of the memory

              Importantly, this method respects the fact that neuronal

              cue-target-interval paradigms where attentional processes are
              examined across relatively protracted periods of time and not at
              the rapid timescales implicated during overt attention tasks. The

              brain systems that have evolved to accomplish sensory-,
              representation-, and action-related functions. Evidence from
              behavioral, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and
              neuroimaging studies, from monkeys and humans, is considered, as

              maximizes episodic short-term memory (STM) and minimizes semantic

              synchronizes selectively in those conditions and time intervals
              where episodic STM demands are maximal. This finding of a
              selective alpha synchronization occurring only in the upper alpha
              band and during highest task demands is surprising because it is
              well known that usually alpha desynchronizes during mental
              activity. Because experiments from our laboratory indicate that
              desynchronization in the upper alpha band is related to semantic
              LTM processes, the present finding suggests that a selective
              synchronization in this frequency band reflects inhibition of
              semantic LTM. It is assumed that once the capacity limits of STM

              This ability is thought to be maintained through the persistent
              discharges of neurons in a network of brain areas centered on the
              prefrontal cortex, as evidenced by neurophysiological recordings
              in nonhuman primates, though both the localization and the neural
              basis of WM has been a matter of debate in recent years. Neural
              correlates of WM are evident in species other than primates,
              including rodents and corvids. A specialized network of
              excitatory and inhibitory neurons, aided by neuromodulatory
              influences of dopamine, is critical for the maintenance of
              neuronal activity. Limitations in WM capacity and duration, as
              well as its enhancement during development, can be attributed to
              properties of neural activity and circuits. Changes in these

              in pathological impairments. WM thus provides a prototypical

  abstract = "A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to
              synthesize the existing literature on how transcranial magnetic
              stimulation (TMS) has been used to modulate episodic memory.
              Given the numerous parameters of TMS protocols and experimental
              design characteristics that can be manipulated, a mechanistic
              understanding of how changes in the combination of parameters
              (e.g., frequency, timing, intensity, targeted brain region,
              memory task) modulate episodic memory is needed. To address this,
              we reviewed 59 studies and conducted a meta-analysis on 245
              effect sizes from 37 articles on healthy younger adults (N =
              1,061). Analyses revealed generally more beneficial effects of
              1-Hz rTMS vs. other frequencies on episodic memory. Moderation
              analyses revealed complex interactions as online 20-Hz rTMS
              protocols led to negative effects, while offline 20-Hz rTMS led
              to enhancing effects. There was also an interaction between
              stimulation intensity and frequency as 20-Hz rTMS had more
              negative effects when applied below- vs. at-motor threshold.
              Conversely, 1-Hz rTMS had more beneficial effects than other
              frequencies when applied below- vs. at- or above-motor threshold.
              No reliable aggregate or hypothesized interactions were found
              when assessing stimulation site (frontal vs. parietal cortex,
              left vs. right hemisphere), stimulated memory process (during
              encoding vs. retrieval), the type of retrieval
              (associative/recollection vs. item/familiarity), or the type of
              control comparison (active vs. sham or no TMS) on episodic
              memory. However, there is insufficient data to make strong
              inference based on the lack of aggregate or two-way interactions
              between these factors, or to assess more complex (e.g., 3-way)
              interactions. We reviewed the effects on other populations
              (healthy older adults and clinical populations), but systematic
              comparison of parameters was also prevented due to insufficient
              data. A database of parameters and effects sizes is available as
              an open source repository so that data from studies can be
              continuously accumulated in order to facilitate future
              meta-analysis. In conclusion, modulating episodic memory relies
              on complex interactions among the numerous moderator variables
              that can be manipulated. Therefore, rigorous, systematic
              comparisons need to be further investigated as the body of
              literature grows in order to fully understand the combination of
              parameters that lead to enhancing, detrimental or null effects on

              components are often conflated, such as when sensory information
              in working memory is encoded and tested at the same location. We
              developed a task in which we dissociated the past (encoded
              location) and future (to-be-tested location) attributes of visual
              contents in working memory. This enabled us to independently

              how attentional modulation varies by cell type and across
              cortical layers. Here, we test whether attention acts
              non-selectively across cortical layers or whether it engages the
              laminar circuit in specific and selective ways. We find layer-
              and cell-class-specific differences in several different forms of
              attentional modulation in area V4. Broad-spiking neurons in the
              superficial layers exhibit attention-mediated increases in firing
              rate and decreases in variability. Spike count correlations are
              highest in the input layer and attention serves to reduce these
              correlations. Superficial and input layer neurons exhibit
              attention-dependent decreases in low-frequency (<10 Hz)
              coherence, but deep layer neurons exhibit increases in coherence
              in the beta and gamma frequency ranges. Our study provides a

              feedforward sensory signals with internally generated feedback
              signals. Feedback signals are believed to play an important role
              in driving false percepts, that is, seeing things that are not
              actually there. Feedforward and feedback influences on perception
              can be studied using layer-specific fMRI, which we used here to
              interrogate neural activity underlying high-confidence false
              percepts while healthy human participants (N = 25, male and
              female) performed a perceptual orientation discrimination task.
              Auditory cues implicitly signaled the most likely upcoming
              orientation (referred to here as expectations). These
              expectations induced orientation-specific templates in the deep
              and superficial layers of V2, without affecting perception. In
              contrast, the orientation of falsely perceived stimuli with high
              confidence was reflected in the middle input layers of V2,
              suggesting a feedforward signal contributing to false percepts.
              The prevalence of high-confidence false percepts was related to
              everyday hallucination severity in a separate online sample (N =
              100), suggesting a possible link with abnormal perceptual
              experiences. These results reveal a potential feedforward
              mechanism underlying false percepts, reflected by spontaneous
              stimulus-like activity in the input layers of the visual cortex,

              suggested to arise through excessive feedback signals. However,
              feedforward contributions to false percepts have remained largely
              understudied. Laminar fMRI has been shown to be useful in
              distinguishing feedforward from feedback activity as it allows
              the imaging of different cortical layers. In the present study we
              demonstrate that although cued orientations are encoded in the
              feedback layers of the visual cortex, the content of the false
              percepts are encoded in the feedforward layers and did not rely
              on these cued orientations. This shows that false percepts can in
              principle emerge from random feedforward signals in the visual
              cortex, with possible implications for disorders hallmarked by
              hallucinations like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.",

  abstract = "In human scalp EEG recordings, both sustained potentials and
              alpha-band oscillations are present during the delay period of
              working memory tasks and may therefore reflect the representation
              of information in working memory. However, these signals may
              instead reflect support mechanisms rather than the actual
              contents of memory. In particular, alpha-band oscillations have
              been tightly tied to spatial attention and may not reflect
              location-independent memory representations per se. To determine
              how sustained and oscillating EEG signals are related to
              attention and working memory, we attempted to decode which of 16
              orientations was being held in working memory by human observers
              (both women and men). We found that sustained EEG activity could
              be used to decode the remembered orientation of a stimulus, even
              when the orientation of the stimulus varied independently of its
              location. Alpha-band oscillations also carried clear information
              about the location of the stimulus, but they provided little or
              no information about orientation independently of location. Thus,
              sustained potentials contain information about the object
              properties being maintained in working memory, consistent with
              previous evidence of a tight link between these potentials and
              working memory capacity. In contrast, alpha-band oscillations
              primarily carry location information, consistent with their link
              to spatial attention.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Working memory plays
              a key role in cognition, and working memory is impaired in
              several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Previous research
              has suggested that human scalp EEG recordings contain signals
              that reflect the neural representation of information in working
              memory. However, to conclude that a neural signal actually
              represents the object being remembered, it is necessary to show
              that the signal contains fine-grained information about that
              object. Here, we show that sustained voltages in human EEG
              recordings contain fine-grained information about the orientation

              scheme, V2 and V3 form nearly symmetrical halves with respect to
              the calcarine sulcus, with the dorsal halves representing lower
              contralateral quadrants, and the ventral halves representing
              upper contralateral quadrants. This arrangement is considered to
              be consistent across individuals, and thus predictable with
              reasonable accuracy using templates. However, data that deviate
              from this expected pattern have been observed, but mainly treated
              as artifactual. Here, we systematically investigate individual
              variability in the visual field maps of human early visual cortex
              using the 7T Human Connectome Project (HCP) retinotopy dataset.

              Recent work suggests this activity is in response to both the
              visual stimulation and the abrupt appearance, or salience, of the
              presentation. Here we present a novel method for distinguishing
              the two, based on the timing of random and nonrandom
              presentations. We examined these contributions in frontal eye
              field (FEF; N = 51) and as a comparison, an early stage in the
              primary visual cortex (V1; N = 15) of male monkeys (Macaca
              mulatta). An array of identical stimuli was presented within and
              outside the neuronal RF while we manipulated salience by varying
              the time between stimulus presentations. We hypothesized that the
              rapid presentation would reduce salience (the sudden appearance
              within the visual field) of a stimulus at any one location, and
              thus decrease responses driven by salience in the RF. We found
              that when the interstimulus interval decreased from 500 to 16 ms
              there was an approximate 79\% reduction in the FEF response
              compared with an estimated 17\% decrease in V1. This reduction in
              FEF response for rapid presentation was evident even when the
              random sequence preceding a stimulus did not stimulate the RF for
              500 ms. The time course of these response changes in FEF suggest
              that salience is represented much earlier (<100 ms following
              stimulus onset) than previously estimated. Our results suggest
              that the contribution of salience dominates at higher levels of
              the visual system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The neuronal responses
              in early visual processing [e.g., primary visual cortex (V1)]
              reflect primarily the retinal stimulus. Processing in higher
              visual areas is modulated by a combination of the visual
              stimulation and contextual factors, such as salience, but
              identifying these components separately has been difficult. Here

              microsaccades by shifts of covert attention in a classical
              spatial cueing paradigm. First, we replicate the suppression of
              microsaccades with a minimum rate about 150 ms after cue onset.
              Second, as a new finding we observe microsaccadic enhancement
              with a maximum rate about 350 ms after presentation of the cue.
              Third, we find a modulation of the orientation towards the cue
              direction. These multiple influences of visual attention on
              microsaccades accentuate their role for visual information
              processing. Furthermore, our results suggest that microsaccades
              can be used to map the orientation of visual attention in

  abstract = "Covert spatial attention is thought to facilitate the maintenance
              of locations in working memory, and EEG $\alpha$-band activity
              (8-12 Hz) is proposed to track the focus of covert attention.
              Recent work has shown that multivariate patterns of $\alpha$-band
              activity track the polar angle of remembered locations relative
              to fixation. However, a defining feature of covert spatial
              attention is that it facilitates processing in a specific region
              of the visual field, and prior work has not determined whether
              patterns of $\alpha$-band activity track the two-dimensional
              (2-D) coordinates of remembered stimuli within a visual hemifield
              or are instead maximally sensitive to the polar angle of
              remembered locations around fixation. Here, we used a lateralized
              spatial estimation task, in which observers remembered the
              location of one or two target dots presented to one side of
              fixation, to test this question. By applying a linear
              discriminant classifier to the topography of $\alpha$-band
              activity, we found that we were able to decode the location of
              remembered stimuli. Critically, model comparison revealed that
              the pattern of classifier choices observed across remembered
              positions was best explained by a model assuming that
              $\alpha$-band activity tracks the 2-D coordinates of remembered
              locations rather than a model assuming that $\alpha$-band
              activity tracks the polar angle of remembered locations relative

              A substantial body of work has shown that patterns of EEG
              $\alpha$-band activity track the angular coordinates of attended
              and remembered stimuli around fixation, but whether these
              patterns track the two-dimensional coordinates of stimuli
              presented within a visual hemifield remains an open question.
              Here, we demonstrate that $\alpha$-band activity tracks the
              two-dimensional coordinates of remembered stimuli within a
              hemifield, showing that $\alpha$-band activity reflects a

              Activity on Subjective Awareness of Auditory and Visual Stimuli",
  author   = "Cunningham, Emily and Zimnicki, Clementine and Beck, Diane M",
  abstract = "Alpha rhythmic activity is often suggested to exert an inhibitory
              influence on information processing. However, relatively little
              is known about how reported alpha-related effects are influenced
              by a potential confounding element of the neural signal,
              power-law scaling. In the current study, we systematically
              examine the effect of accounting for 1/f activity on the relation
              between prestimulus alpha power and human behavior during both
              auditory and visual detection (N = 27; 19 female, 6 male, 2
              nonbinary). The results suggest that, at least in the
              scalp-recorded EEG signal, the difference in alpha power often
              reported before visual hits versus misses is probably best
              thought of as a combination of narrowband alpha and broadband
              shifts. That is, changes in broadband parameters (exponent and
              offset of 1/f-like activity) also appear to be strong predictors
              of the subsequent awareness of visual stimuli. Neither changes in
              posterior alpha power nor changes in 1/f-like activity reliably
              predicted detection of auditory stimuli. These results appear
              consistent with suggestions that broadband changes in the
              scalp-recorded EEG signal may account for a portion of prior
              results linking alpha band dynamics to visuospatial attention and
              behavior, and suggest that systematic re-examination of existing
              data may be warranted.Significance Statement Fluctuations in
              alpha band (∼8-12 Hz) activity systematically follow the
              allocation of attention across space and sensory modality.
              Increases in alpha amplitude, which often precede failures to
              report awareness of threshold visual stimuli, are suggested to
              exert an inhibitory influence on information processing. However,
              fluctuations in alpha activity are often confounded with changes
              in the broadband 1/f-like pattern of the neural signal. When both
              factors are considered, we find that changes in broadband
              activity are as effective as narrowband alpha activity as
              predictors of subsequent visual detection. These results are
              consistent with emerging understanding of the potential
              functional importance of broadband changes in the neural signal
              and may have significant consequences for our understanding of

              brain regions. Specifically, the posterior alpha frequency band
              (7-12 Hz) is thought to gate bottom-up visual information flow by
              inhibition during visual processing. Evidence shows that

              functional connectivity in resting state connectivity networks,
              supporting alpha mediates neural communication through coherency.
              However, these findings have mainly been derived from spontaneous

              at the IAF and at neighboring frequencies within the alpha band

              the different stimulation conditions and applying network-based
              statistics. This suggests that rhythmic stimulation at the IAF
              frequency induces a higher degree of synchronicity of neural
              activity across the occipital and parietal cortex, which supports
              the role of the alpha oscillation in gating information flow

              of this study was to establish dose-response relationships of TMS
              stimulation in DLPFC by means of concurrent TMS/fMRI. Methods
              Here, we stimulated 15 subjects at different stimulation
              intensities of 80, 90, 100 and 110\% relative to the motor
              threshold during concurrent TMS/fMRI. The experiment comprised
              two sessions: one session to collect anatomical data in order to
              perform neuronavigation and one session dedicated to
              dose-response mapping. We calculated GLMs for each intensity
              level and each subject, as well as at a group-level per
              intensity. Results On a group level, we show that the strongest
              BOLD-response was at 100\% stimulation. However, investigating
              individual dose response-relationships showed differences in
              response patterns across the group: subjects that responded to
              subthreshold stimulation, subjects that required above threshold
              stimulation in order to show a significant BOLD-response and
              atypical responders. Conclusions We observed qualitative
              inter-subject variability in terms of dose-response relationship
              to TMS over left DLPFC, which hints towards the motor threshold
              not being directly transferable to the excitability of the DLPFC.
              Concurrent TMS/fMRI might have the potential to improve response
              rates to rTMS applications. As such, it may be valuable in the
              future to consider implementing this approach prior to clinical
              TMS or validating more cost-effective methods to determine dose

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The initiation of memory guided saccades is known to
              be controlled by the frontal eye field (FEF). Recent
              physiological studies showed the existence of an area close to
              FEF that controls also vergence initiation and execution. This
              study is to explore the effect of transcranial magnetic
              simulation (TMS) over FEF on the control of memory-guided
              saccade-vergence eye movements. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              Subjects had to make an eye movement in dark towards a target
              flashed 1 sec earlier (memory delay); the location of the target
              relative to fixation point was such as to require either a
              vergence along the median plane, or a saccade, or a saccade with
              vergence; trials were interleaved. Single pulse TMS was applied
              on the left or right FEF; it was delivered at 100 ms after the
              end of memory delay, i.e. extinction of fixation LED that was the
              ``go'' signal. Twelve healthy subjects participated in the study.
              TMS of left or right FEF prolonged the latency of all types of
              eye movements; the increase varied from 21 to 56 ms and was
              particularly strong for the divergence movements. This indicates
              that FEF is involved in the initiation of all types of memory
              guided movement in the 3D space. TMS of the FEF also altered the
              accuracy but only for leftward saccades combined with either
              convergence or divergence; intrasaccadic vergence also increased
              after TMS of the FEF. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results
              suggest anisotropy in the quality of space memory and are
              discussed in the context of other known perceptual motor
              anisotropies.",

              of visual targets presented either within a single eye fixation
              (Fixation Task) or across a saccade (Saccade Task). TMS pulses
              were randomly delivered at one of 3 time intervals around the
              time of the saccade, or at equivalent times in the Fixation Task.
              A No-TMS control confirmed that subjects could normally retain
              approximately 3 visual features. TMS in the Fixation Task had no
              effect compared with No-TMS, but differences among TMS times were

  abstract = "Motor actions, such as reaching or grasping, can be decoded from
              fMRI activity of early visual cortex (EVC) in sighted humans.
              This effect can depend on vision or visual imagery, or
              alternatively, could be driven by mechanisms independent of
              visual experience. Here, we show that the actions of reaching in
              different directions can be reliably decoded from fMRI activity
              of EVC in congenitally blind humans (both sexes). Thus, neither
              visual experience nor visual imagery is necessary for EVC to
              represent action-related information. We also demonstrate that,
              within EVC of blind humans, the accuracy of reach direction
              decoding is highest in areas typically representing foveal vision
              and gradually decreases in areas typically representing
              peripheral vision. We propose that this might indicate the
              existence of a predictive, hard-wired mechanism of aligning
              action and visual spaces. This mechanism might send
              action-related information primarily to the high-resolution
              foveal visual areas, which are critical for guiding and online
              correction of motor actions. Finally, we show that, beyond EVC,
              the decoding of reach direction in blind humans is most accurate
              in dorsal stream areas known to be critical for visuo-spatial and
              visuo-motor integration in the sighted. Thus, these areas can
              develop space and action representations even in the lifelong
              absence of vision. Overall, our findings in congenitally blind
              humans match previous research on the action system in the
              sighted, and suggest that the development of action
              representations in the human brain might be largely independent
              of visual experience.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Early visual cortex
              (EVC) was traditionally thought to process only visual signals
              from the retina. Recent studies proved this account incomplete,
              and showed EVC involvement in many activities not directly
              related to incoming visual information, such as memory, sound, or
              action processing. Is EVC involved in these activities because of
              visual imagery? Here, we show robust reach direction
              representation in EVC of humans born blind. This demonstrates
              that EVC can represent actions independently of vision and visual
              imagery. Beyond EVC, we found that reach direction representation
              in blind humans is strongest in dorsal brain areas, critical for
              action processing in the sighted. This suggests that the

              artificial sensory encoding, and it holds a crucial role in
              prosthetic devices restoring sensory perception in individuals
              with disabilities. For example, in visual prostheses, one key
              aspect of artificial image encoding is to downsample images

              photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells measured in explanted

              after the saccade is generated or adaptation does not occur.
              Here, we tested the hypothesis that when feedback is delayed,
              learning still occurs, but does so through small secondary
              corrective saccades. Using a memory-guided saccade task, we gave
              feedback about the accuracy of saccades that was falsely

              Despite the delayed feedback, over time subjects improved in

              their primary saccades, but via directed corrective saccades made

              stimulus features (e.g., orientation, spatial location, color).
              Goal-directed behavior, such as sustained attention, requires a
              mechanism for the selective prioritization of contextually
              appropriate representations. A candidate mechanism of sustained
              spatial attention is neural activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz),
              whose power in the human EEG covaries with the focus of covert
              attention. Here, we applied an inverted encoding model to assess
              whether spatially selective neural responses could be recovered
              from the topography of alpha-band oscillations during spatial
              attention. Participants were cued to covertly attend to one of
              six spatial locations arranged concentrically around fixation

              reconstructions of the specific attended location beginning

              These results demonstrate that posterior alpha-band oscillations

               task-relevant WM content is first selected and then mapped on to

              Observers remembered two targets for a sequence of two visual

              area (OFA), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). In a
              sample of 30 human participants (22 females, 8 males), we used
              fMRI to measure brain activity patterns elicited by naturalistic
              videos of famous face identities, and compared their
              representational distances in each region with models of the
              differences between identities. We built diverse candidate
              models, ranging from low-level image-computable properties
              (pixel-wise, GIST, and Gabor-Jet dissimilarities), through
              higher-level image-computable descriptions (OpenFace deep neural
              network, trained to cluster faces by identity), to complex
              human-rated properties (perceived similarity, social traits, and
              gender). We found marked differences in the information
              represented by the FFA and OFA. Dissimilarities between face
              identities in FFA were accounted for by differences in perceived
              similarity, Social Traits, Gender, and by the OpenFace network.
              In contrast, representational distances in OFA were mainly driven
              by differences in low-level image-based properties (pixel-wise
              and Gabor-Jet dissimilarities). Our results suggest that,
              although FFA and OFA can both discriminate between identities,
              the FFA representation is further removed from the image,
              encoding higher-level perceptual and social face
              information.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recent studies using fMRI have
              shown that several face-responsive brain regions can distinguish
              between different face identities. It is however unclear whether
              these different face-responsive regions distinguish between
              identities in similar or different ways. We used representational
              similarity analysis to investigate the computations within three
              brain regions in response to naturalistically varying videos of
              face identities. Our results revealed that two regions, the
              fusiform face area and the occipital face area, encode distinct
              identity information about faces. Although identity can be
              decoded from both regions, identity representations in fusiform
              face area primarily contained information about social traits,
              gender, and high-level visual features, whereas occipital face
              area primarily represented lower-level image features.",

  abstract = "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a magnetic field to
              ``carry'' a short lasting electrical current pulse into the brain
              where it stimulates neurones, particularly in superficial regions
              of cerebral cortex. TMS can interfere with cognitive functions in
              two ways. A high intensity TMS pulse causes a synchronised high
              frequency burst of discharge in a relatively large population of
              neurones that is terminated by a long lasting GABAergic
              inhibition. The combination of artificial synchronisation of
              activity followed by depression effectively disrupts perceptual,
              motor and cognitive processes in the human brain. This transient
              neurodisruption has been termed a ``virtual lesion''. Smaller
              intensities of stimulation produce less activity; in such cases,
              cognitive operations can probably continue but are disrupted
              because of the added noisy input from the TMS pulse. It is
              usually argued that if a TMS pulse affects performance, then the
              area stimulated must provide an essential contribution to
              behaviour being studied. However, there is one exception to this:
              the pulse could be applied to an area that is not involved in the
              task but which has projections to the critical site. Activation
              of outputs from the site of stimulation could potentially disrupt
              processing at the distant site, interfering with behaviour
              without having any involvement in the task. A final important
              feature of the response to TMS is ``context dependency'', which
              indicates that the response depends on how excitable the cortex
              is at the time the stimulus is applied: if many neurones are
              close to firing threshold then the more of them are recruited by
              the pulse than at rest. Many studies have noted this
              context-dependent modulation. However, it is often assumed that
              the excitability of an area has a simple relationship to activity
              in that area. We argue that this is not necessarily the case.
              Awareness of the problem may help resolve some apparent anomalies
              in the literature.",

              of the dlPFC's laminar circuitry in human WM is not well
              understood. In this study, participants completed a
              delayed-match-to-sample WM task while undergoing functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high resolution, which
              allowed us to examine layer-specific responses of the dlPFC to
              manipulations in WM load and motor response. We conducted
              univariate and multivariate analyses across all periods of the WM
              task: encoding, delay and retrieval. First, we observed that
              superficial layers activate stronger than deep layers to higher
              WM load during the delay period. This aligns with earlier work
              showing preferential superficial layer activation to WM

              of the frontoparietal network to heightened task demands more

              decoding of WM load differences than deep layers during the
              retrieval period. In this context, we could show that decoding of
              WM load in the superficial layer exhibited dynamic changes across
              the encoding, delay and retrieval period of the task, indicative
              of separate WM control processes that occur on the WM content.
              Last, we found that superficial and deep layers are both
              non-differentially involved in the motor response, contradicting
              earlier findings of a preferential deep layer activation in

              the occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), including early visual areas

              work has revealed that VWM signal in OTC is largely sustained by

  title    = "The Mechanism of Macular Sparing",
  author   = "Horton, Jonathan C and Economides, John R and Adams, Daniel L",
  abstract = "Patients with homonymous hemianopia sometimes show preservation
              of the central visual fields, ranging up to 10°. This phenomenon,
              known as macular sparing, has sparked perpetual controversy. Two
              main theories have been offered to explain it. The first theory
              proposes a dual representation of the macula in each hemisphere.
              After loss of one occipital lobe, the back-up representation in
              the remaining occipital lobe is postulated to sustain ipsilateral
              central vision in the blind hemifield. This theory is supported
              by studies showing that some midline retinal ganglion cells
              project to the wrong hemisphere, presumably driving neurons in
              striate cortex that have ipsilateral receptive fields. However,
              more recent electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging
              studies have cast doubt on this theory by showing only a
              minuscule ipsilateral field representation in early visual
              cortical areas. The second theory holds that macular sparing
              arises because the occipital pole, where the macula is
              represented, remains perfused after occlusion of the posterior
              cerebral artery because it receives collateral flow from the
              middle cerebral artery. An objection to this theory is that it
              cannot account for reports of macular sparing in patients after
              loss of an entire occipital lobe. On close scrutiny, such reports
              turn out to be erroneous, arising from inadequate control of
              fixation during visual field testing. Patients seem able to
              detect test stimuli on their blind side within the macula or
              along the vertical meridian because they make surveillance
              saccades. A purported treatment for hemianopia, called vision
              restoration therapy, is based on this error. The dual perfusion
              theory is supported by anatomical studies showing that the middle
              cerebral artery perfuses the occipital pole in many
              individuals.In patients with hemianopia from stroke, neuroimaging
              shows preservation of the occipital pole when macular sparing is
              present. The frontier dividing the infarcted territory of the
              posterior cerebral artery and the preserved territory of the
              middle cerebral artery is variable, but always falls within the
              representation of the macula, because the macula is so highly
              magnified. For physicians, macular sparing was an important
              neurological sign in acute hemianopia because it signified a
              posterior cerebral artery occlusion. Modern neuroimaging has
              supplanted the importance of that clinical sign but at the same
              time confirmed its validity. For patients, macular sparing
              remains important because it mitigates the impact of hemianopia
              and preserves the ability to read fluently.",

              ensembles of neurons (or 'engram cells') and that successful
              recall involves reactivation of these ensembles. A logical
              extension of this idea is that forgetting occurs when engram
              cells cannot be reactivated. Forms of 'natural forgetting' vary
              considerably in terms of their underlying mechanisms, time course

              natural recall cues) to an inaccessible state (where they

              environmental conditions and we therefore propose that forgetting
              is a form of neuroplasticity that alters engram cell
              accessibility in a manner that is sensitive to mismatches between
              expectations and the environment. Moreover, we hypothesize that

              coil. A wide range of coils from different vendors are currently
              used with different stimulation properties. This decreases the
              comparability of study results. OBJECTIVE: To systematically
              compare widely used commercial TMS coils concerning their
              focality, stimulation depth and efficacy. To provide validated
              models and data of these coils for accurate simulations of the
              induced electric fields. METHODS: We reconstructed the magnetic
              vector potential of 25 commercially available TMS coils of
              different vendors from measurements of their magnetic fields.
              Most coils had a figure-of-eight configuration. We employed the
              reconstructed magnetic vector potential in simulations of the
              electric field in a spherical head model. We estimated the motor
              thresholds of the coil-stimulator combinations using the
              calculated fields, the pulse waveforms and a leaky integrator
              model of the neural membrane. RESULTS: Our results confirm a
              previously reported systematic trade-off between focality and
              relative depth of stimulation. However, neither the peak field
              strength in the ``cortex'' of the sphere model nor the estimated
              motor thresholds were strongly related to the two former measures

              successful recall involves the reactivation of these cellular
              networks. However, significant gaps remain in connecting these
              cell ensembles with the process of forgetting. Here, we utilized
              a mouse model of object memory and investigated the conditions in
              which a memory could be preserved, retrieved, or forgotten.
              Direct modulation of engram activity via optogenetic stimulation
              or inhibition either facilitated or prevented the recall of an
              object memory. In addition, through behavioral and
              pharmacological interventions, we successfully prevented or
              accelerated forgetting of an object memory. Finally, we showed
              that these results can be explained by a computational model in
              which engrams that are subjectively less relevant for adaptive

               An extensive body of research has attributed critical roles to
               frontal and parietal cortex in WM. However, this research has
               been inconsistent as to the precise roles that these regions

               from one another. This registered report will use fMRI,
               transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and computational
               modeling to clarify the source(s) of limitations in the quantity

               then use focal TMS to characterize the causal involvement of

              participants that items in WM are differentially susceptible to
              disruptive TMS, depending on their state, determined either by
              task relevance or serial position. Across two experiments, we
              applied TMS to area MT+ during the WM retention of two motion
              directions. In Experiment 1, we used an ``incidental cue'' to
              bring one of the two targets into a privileged state. In
              Experiment 2, we presented the targets sequentially so that the
              last item was in a privileged state by virtue of recency. In both

              differentially affected by TMS, depending on the state of the

              generated during mental imagery are similar to patterns of
              activity generated during perception. This finding implies that
              low-level visual features (e.g., space, spatial frequency, and
              orientation) are encoded during mental imagery. However, the
              specific hypothesis that low-level visual features are encoded
              during mental imagery is difficult to directly test using MVPC.
              The difficulty is especially acute when considering the
              representation of complex, multi-object scenes that can evoke
              multiple sources of variation that are distinct from low-level
              visual features. Therefore, we used a voxel-wise modeling and
              decoding approach to directly test the hypothesis that low-level
              visual features are encoded in activity generated during mental
              imagery of complex scenes. Using fMRI measurements of cortical
              activity evoked by viewing photographs, we constructed voxel-wise

              measured activity as subjects imagined previously memorized works

              low-level visual features encoded in this activity could pick out
              the imagined artwork from among thousands of other randomly

              accuracy depends upon the degree of tuning to low-level visual
              features in the voxels selected for decoding. These results

              stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial random noise stimulation with
              a direct-current offset (tRNS + DC-offset) on working memory (WM)
              performance and task-related electroencephalography (EEG) in
              individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). METHODS: Using
              a sham-controlled, parallel-groups design, 49 participants with
              MDD received either anodal tDCS (N = 16), high-frequency tRNS +
              DC-offset (N = 16), or sham stimulation (N = 17) to the left
              dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 20-minutes. The
              Sternberg WM task was completed with concurrent EEG recording
              before and at 5- and 25-minutes post-stimulation. Event-related
              synchronisation/desynchronisation (ERS/ERD) was calculated for
              theta, upper alpha, and gamma oscillations during WM encoding and
              maintenance. RESULTS: tDCS significantly increased
              parieto-occipital upper alpha ERS/ERD during WM maintenance,
              observed on EEG recorded 5- and 25-minutes post-stimulation. tRNS
              + DC-offset did not significantly alter WM-related oscillatory
              activity when compared to sham stimulation. Neither tDCS nor tRNS
              + DC-offset improved WM performance to a significantly greater
              degree than sham stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Although tDCS induced
              persistent effects on WM-related oscillatory activity, neither
              tDCS nor tRNS + DC-offset enhanced WM performance in MDD.
              SIGNIFICANCE: This reflects the first sham-controlled comparison
              of tDCS and tRNS + DC-offset in MDD. These findings directly
              contrast with evidence of tRNS-induced enhancements in WM in
              healthy individuals.",

              work has suggested that new sensory inputs obligatorily wipe out

              changes in pupil diameter follow internal shifts of attention to
              memoranda of visual stimuli of different brightness maintained in
              working memory, in the absence of any visual stimulation. Across

              compelling example of feedback activation of early visual neurons
              in the absence of bottom-up input occurs during the famous
              Kanizsa illusion, where a triangular shape is perceived, even in
              regions of the image where there is no bottom-up visual evidence
              for it. This illusion increases the firing activity of neurons in
              the primary visual cortex with a receptive field on the illusory
              contour [4]. Feedback signals are largely segregated from
              feedforward signals within each cortical area, with feedforward
              signals arriving in the middle layer, while top-down feedback
              avoids the middle layers and predominantly targets deep and
              superficial layers [1, 2, 5, 6]. Therefore, the feedback-mediated
              activity increase in V1 during the perception of illusory shapes
              should lead to a specific laminar activity profile that is
              distinct from the activity elicited by bottom-up stimulation.
              Here, we used fMRI at high field (7 T) to empirically test this

              feedback activity induced by illusory figures led to a selective

              Recent work leveraging such stimulus control has led to important
              insights; however, these findings are constrained to simple
              visual properties like color and line orientation. There remains
              a critical methodological barrier to characterizing perceptual
              and mnemonic representations of realistic visual experiences.
              Here, we introduce a novel method to systematically control
              visual properties of natural scene stimuli. Using generative
              adversarial networks (GANs), a state-of-the-art deep learning
              technique for creating highly realistic synthetic images, we
              generated scene wheels in which continuously changing visual
              properties smoothly transition between meaningful realistic
              scenes. To validate the efficacy of scene wheels, we conducted
              two behavioral experiments that assess perceptual and mnemonic
              representations attained from the scene wheels. In the perceptual
              validation experiment, we tested whether the continuous
              transition of scene images along the wheel is reflected in human
              perceptual similarity judgment. The perceived similarity of the

              wheels. Reconstruction errors for these scenes resemble error
              distributions observed in prior studies using simple stimulus
              properties. Importantly, perceptual similarity judgment and

              be determined. OBJECTIVE: To develop an automated closed-loop
              system for adjusting TMS parameters (in this work, the stimulus
              orientation) online based on TMS-evoked brain activity measured
              with electroencephalography (EEG). METHODS: We developed an
              automated closed-loop TMS-EEG set-up. In this set-up, the
              stimulus parameters are electronically adjusted with multi-locus
              TMS. As a proof of concept, we developed an algorithm that
              automatically optimizes the stimulation orientation based on
              single-trial EEG responses. We applied the algorithm to determine
              the electric field orientation that maximizes the amplitude of
              the TMS-EEG responses. The validation of the algorithm was

              more information than of retinal origin alone, or that other
              brain structures contribute to vision. Indeed, research across
              the past decades has shown that non-visual information, such as
              neural activity related to reward expectation and value,
              locomotion, working memory and other sensory modalities, can

              disorders. Typically, the stimulation is applied using a
              one-size-fits-all approach with predetermined locations for the
              electrodes, in electric stimulation (TES), or the coil, in
              magnetic stimulation (TMS), which disregards anatomical
              variability between individuals. However, the induced electric
              field distribution in the head largely depends on anatomical
              features implying the need for individually tailored stimulation
              protocols for focal dosing. This requires detailed models of the
              individual head anatomy, combined with electric field
              simulations, to find an optimal stimulation protocol for a given
              cortical target. Considering the anatomical and functional
              complexity of different brain disorders and pathologies, it is
              crucial to account for the anatomical variability in order to
              translate TBS from a research tool into a viable option for
              treatment. In this article we present a new method, called CHARM,
              for automated segmentation of fifteen different head tissues from
              magnetic resonance (MR) scans. The new method compares favorably
              to two freely available software tools on a five-tissue
              segmentation task, while obtaining reasonable segmentation
              accuracy over all fifteen tissues. The method automatically
              adapts to variability in the input scans and can thus be directly
              applied to clinical or research scans acquired with different
              scanners, sequences or settings. We show that an increase in
              automated segmentation accuracy results in a lower relative error
              in electric field simulations when compared to anatomical head
              models constructed from reference segmentations. However, also
              the improved segmentations and, by implication, the electric
              field simulations are affected by systematic artifacts in the
              input MR scans. As long as the artifacts are unaccounted for,
              this can lead to local simulation differences up to 30\% of the
              peak field strength on reference simulations. Finally, we
              exemplarily demonstrate the effect of including all fifteen
              tissue classes in the field simulations against the standard
              approach of using only five tissue classes and show that for
              specific stimulation configurations the local differences can
              reach 10\% of the peak field strength.",

              (MEG) data. Besides the intended effect of the attenuation of
              signal components considered as noise, filtering can also result
              in various unintended adverse filter effects (distortions such as
              smoothing) and filter artifacts. METHOD: We give some practical
              guidelines for the evaluation of filter responses (impulse and
              frequency response) and the selection of filter types
              (high-pass/low-pass/band-pass/band-stop; finite/infinite impulse
              response, FIR/IIR) and filter parameters (cutoff frequencies,

              optimize signal-to-noise ratio and avoid or reduce signal

              of these games poses a barrier to quantitative estimates of
              planning depth. Conversely, common planning tasks in cognitive

              expertise in a complex board game that offers ample opportunity
              for skilled players to plan deeply. We use model fitting methods

              mechanisms have been proposed to underlie these effects: (1)
              virtual lesion--TMS suppresses neural signals; (2) preferential
              activation of less active neurons--TMS drives up activity in the
              stimulated area, but active neurons are saturating; (3) noise
              generation--TMS adds random neuronal activity, and its effect
              interacts with stimulus intensity; and (4) noise generation--TMS
              adds random neuronal activity, and its effect depends on TMS
              intensity. Here we explore these hypotheses by investigating the
              effects of TMS on early visual cortex by assessing the contrast
              response function while varying the adaptation state of the
              observers. We tested human participants in an orientation
              discrimination task, in which performance is contingent upon
              contrast sensitivity. Before each trial, neuronal activation of
              visual cortex was altered through contrast adaptation to two
              flickering gratings. In a factorial design, with or without
              adaptation, a single TMS pulse was delivered simultaneously with
              targets of varying contrast. Adaptation decreased contrast
              sensitivity. The effect of TMS on performance was state
              dependent: TMS decreased contrast sensitivity in the absence of
              adaptation but increased it after adaptation. None of the
              proposed mechanisms can account for the results in their
              entirety, in particular, for the facilitatory effect at

              alternative hypothesis: TMS effects are activity dependent, so

              cortex (V1) and hippocampus adhere to the postulated properties
              of the SR after visual sequence learning. Participants were
              exposed to an arbitrary spatiotemporal sequence consisting of

              full sequence (e.g., C-D), but not at the predecessor locations
              (e.g., A). This highlights that visual representations are skewed

              developed a coactivation profile that showed sensitivity to the

              differences in the amplitude of these population responses should
              be related to differences in memory performance [14, 15]. Here,

              comprising 33 repeats of simple motor, visual, and cognitive
              paradigms, were collected over a period of 2 months on a single
              male subject. For each paradigm, the inclusion of
              session-by-condition interactions explained a significant amount
              of error variance (P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons)
              over a model assuming a common activation magnitude across all
              sessions. However, many of those voxels displaying significant
              session-by-condition interactions were not seen in a multisession
              fixed-effects analysis of the same data set; i.e., they were not
              activated on average across all sessions. Most voxels that were
              both significantly variable and activated on average across all
              sessions did not survive a random-effects analysis (modeling
              between-session variance). We interpret our results as
              demonstrating that correct inference about subject responses to
              activation tasks can be derived through the use of a statistical
              model which accounts for both within- and between-session
              variance, combined with an appropriately large session sample
              size. If researchers have access to only a single session from a
              single subject, erroneous conclusions are a possibility, in that
              responses specific to this single session may be claimed to be
              typical responses for this subject.",

              adaptive behavior. Neuronal activity in PPC reflects perceptual
              decision making across behavioral tasks, but the mechanistic
              involvement of PPC is unclear. In an audiovisual change detection
              task, we tested the hypothesis that PPC is required to arbitrate
              between the noisy inputs from the two different modalities and
              help decide in which modality a sensory change occurred. In

              population-level encoding of task-relevant visual and auditory
              stimuli, trial history, as well as upcoming behavioral responses.
              However, despite these rich neural correlates, which would
              theoretically be sufficient to solve the task, optogenetic
              inactivation of PPC did not affect visual or auditory

              perception and behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe Posterior
              Parietal Cortex (PPC) is active during many daily tasks, but
              capturing its function has remained challenging. Specifically, it
              is proposed to function as an integration hub for multisensory
              inputs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, rather than
              classical cue integration, mouse PPC is involved in the
              segregation and discrimination of sensory modalities.
              Surprisingly, even though neural activity tracked current and
              past sensory stimuli and reflected the ongoing decision-making
              process, optogenetic inactivation did not affect task
              performance. Thus, we show an apparent redundancy of sensory and
              task-related activity in mouse PPC. These results narrow down the
              function of parietal circuits, as well as direct the search for
              those neural dynamics that causally drive perceptual decision
              making.",

              [1, 2]. For instance, past work has shown that stimulus position
              is spontaneously remembered when non-spatial features are stored.
              Item recognition is enhanced when memoranda appear at the same
              location where they were encoded [3-5], and accessing non-spatial
              information elicits shifts of spatial attention to the original
              position of the stimulus [6, 7]. However, these findings do not
              establish that a persistent, active representation of stimulus
              position is maintained in WM because similar effects have also
              been documented following storage in long-term memory [8, 9].
              Here we show that the spatial position of the memorandum is
              actively coded by persistent neural activity during a non-spatial

              working memory have been studied for decades. Here we outline a
              conceptual framework describing interactions between these areas
              during working memory, and review evidence for key elements of
              this model. We specifically suggest that a top-down signal sent
              from prefrontal to sensory areas drives oscillations in these
              areas. Spike timing within sensory areas becomes locked to these
              working-memory-driven oscillations, and the phase of spiking
              conveys information about the representation available within
              these areas. Downstream areas receiving these phase-locked spikes
              from sensory areas can recover this information via a combination
              of coherent oscillations and gating of input efficacy based on
              the phase of their local oscillations. Although the conceptual
              framework is based on prefrontal interactions with sensory areas
              during working memory, we also discuss the broader implications
              of this framework for flexible communication between brain areas

              data, two measures of orientation tuning selectivity, circular
              variance and orientation bandwidth, were computed from the tuning
              curves. Circular variance is a global measure of the shape of the
              tuning curve, whereas orientation bandwidth is a local measure of
              the sharpness of the tuning curve around its peak. Circular
              variance in V1 was distributed broadly, indicating a great
              diversity of orientation selectivity. This diversity was also
              reflected in the individual cortical layers. However, there was a
              tendency for neurons with high circular variance, meaning low
              selectivity for orientation, to be concentrated in layers 4C, 3B,
              and 5. The relative variation of orientation bandwidth across the
              cortical layers was less than for circular variance, but it
              showed a similar laminar dependence. Neurons with large
              orientation bandwidth were found predominantly in layers 4C and
              3B. There was a weak correlation between orientation selectivity
              and the level of spontaneous activity of the neurons. We also
              assigned a response modulation ratio for each cell, which is a

              distribution of tuning selectivity is found in all cortical

              magnetic resonance imaging to identify cortical areas with
              activity that persists throughout working memory delays with the
              goal of testing if such activity represents visuospatial

              We find that the same areas in the PFC and PPC that show
              persistent activity during the maintenance of a working memory
              representation also show persistent activity during the
              maintenance of spatial attention and the maintenance of motor
              intention. Therefore, we conclude that persistent activity is not
              specific to working memory, but instead, carries information that
              can be used generally to support a variety of cognitions.
              Specifically, activity in topographically organized maps of
              prioritized space in PFC and PPC could be read out to guide
              attention allocation, spatial memory, and motor planning.",

              resource-limited it is, raising questions about how this resource
              is shared or split across memoranda. Since objects are rarely
              equally important in the real world, we ask how people split this
              resource in settings where objects have different levels of
              importance. In a psychophysical experiment, participants
              remembered the location of four targets with different

              to low-priority targets relative to the true probability of being

               increasingly experiencing a state of information overload.
               Statistics show that we are interrupted every three minutes
               during the course of the work day. Multitasking between email,
               cell-phone, text messages, and four or five websites while
               listening to an iPod forces the brain to process more and more
               informaton at greater and greater speeds. And yet the human
               brain has hardly changed in the last 40,000 years.Are all these
               high-tech advances overtaxing our Stone Age brains or is the
               constant flood of information good for us, giving our brains the
               daily exercise they seem to crave? In The Overflowing Brain,
               cognitive scientist Torkel Klingberg takes us on a journey into
               the limits and possibilities of the brain. He suggests that we
               should acknowledge and embrace our desire for information and
               mental challenges, but try to find a balance between demand and
               capacity. Klingberg explores the cognitive demands, or
               ``complexity,'' of everyday life and how the brain tries to meet
               them. He identifies different types of attention, such as
               stimulus-driven and controlled attention, but focuses chiefly on
               ``working memory,'' our capacity to keep information in mind for
               short periods of time. Dr Klingberg asserts that working memory
               capacity, long thought to be static and hardwired in the brain,
               can be improved by training, and that the increasing demands on
               working memory may actually have a constructive effect: as
               demands on the human brain increase, so does its capacity.The
               book ends with a discussion of the future of brain development
               and how we can best handle information overload in our everyday
               lives. Klingberg suggests how we might find a balance between
               demand and capacity and move from feeling overwhelmed to deeply
               engaged.",

  abstract = "The detection and segmentation of meaningful figures from their
              background is one of the primary functions of vision. While work
              in nonhuman primates has implicated early visual mechanisms in
              this figure-ground modulation, neuroimaging in humans has instead
              largely ascribed the processing of figures and objects to higher
              stages of the visual hierarchy. Here, we used high-field fMRI at
              7 Tesla to measure BOLD responses to task-irrelevant
              orientation-defined figures in human early visual cortex (N = 6,
              four females). We used a novel population receptive field
              mapping-based approach to resolve the spatial profiles of two
              constituent mechanisms of figure-ground modulation: a local
              boundary response, and a further enhancement spanning the full
              extent of the figure region that is driven by global differences
              in features. Reconstructing the distinct spatial profiles of
              these effects reveals that figure enhancement modulates responses
              in human early visual cortex in a manner consistent with a
              mechanism of automatic, contextually driven feedback from higher
              visual areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A core function of the visual
              system is to parse complex 2D input into meaningful figures. We
              do so constantly and seamlessly, both by processing information
              about visible edges and by analyzing large-scale differences
              between figure and background. While influential neurophysiology
              work has characterized an intriguing mechanism that enhances V1
              responses to perceptual figures, we have a poor understanding of
              how the early visual system contributes to figure-ground
              processing in humans. Here, we use advanced computational
              analysis methods and high-field human fMRI data to resolve the
              distinct spatial profiles of local edge and global figure
              enhancement in the early visual system (V1 and LGN); the latter
              is distinct and consistent with a mechanism of automatic,

              psychiatric disorders, necessitating a caution in terms of
              interpreting research results. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at
              systematically evaluating a representative sample of research
              conducted using NIBS interventions in neuro-psychiatric
              conditions, and assessing the power these studies achieved, given
              their sample sizes. METHODS: A database search was conducted with
              defined keyword combinations. Using reported summary effects of
              the meta-analyses as estimate of the true effects, we calculated
              achieved power of each individual study to detect the effect
              indicated by the corresponding meta-analysis. RESULTS: Findings
              suggest that mean and median powers in the field of NIBS were
              0.50, with a mode at 0.83 (range 0.05-1.00). When analysed
              separately, the median powers were 0.27 for tDCS, 0.70 for TMS
              and 0.97 for ECT. These studies had a mean total sample size of
              22.2 $\pm$ 24.9 subjects and the median reported effect size
              across all studies was 0.61. CONCLUSION: According to our
              findings, studies conducted in NIBS miss around 50\% of true
              positive results. Further, it appears that most of the
              researchers in this field chase statistical significance with

               maps with each species having similar, but not identical, maps.
               The introduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging made
               it possible to identify visual field maps in human cortex,
               including several near (1) medial occipital (V1,V2,V3), (2)

              human brain while also considering its limitations. The iEEG
              signal provides anatomically precise information about the
              selective engagement of neuronal populations at the millimeter
              scale and the temporal dynamics of their engagement at the
              millisecond scale. If several nodes of a given network are
              monitored simultaneously with implanted electrodes, the iEEG
              signals can also reveal information about functional interactions
              within and across networks during different stages of neural
              computation. As such, human iEEG can complement other methods of
              neuroscience beyond simply replicating what is already known, or
              can be known, from noninvasive lines of research in humans or
              from invasive recordings in nonhuman mammalian brains.",

               using multiple methods, spanning a wide range of spatial and
               temporal resolutions. We investigated the relationship between
               electric field potentials measured with electrocorticography
               (ECoG) and the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response
               measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
               set out to explain the full set of measurements by modeling the
               underlying neural circuits. RESULTS: ECoG responses in visual
               cortex can be separated into two visually driven components. One
               component is a specific temporal response that follows each
               stimulus contrast reversal (``stimulus locked''); the other
               component is an increase in the response variance
               (``asynchronous''). For electrodes in visual cortex (V1, V2,
               V3), the two measures respond to stimuli in the same region of
               visual space, but they have different spatial summation
               properties. The stimulus-locked ECoG component sums contrast
               approximately linearly across space; spatial summation in the
               asynchronous ECoG component is subadditive. Spatial summation
               measured using BOLD closely matches the asynchronous component.
               We created a neural simulation that accurately captures the main
               features of the ECoG time series; in the simulation, the
               stimulus-locked and asynchronous components arise from different
               neural circuits. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that
               the two ECoG components arise from different neural sources
               within the same cortical region. The spatial summation
               measurements and simulations suggest that the BOLD response

               asynchronous broadband ECoG component.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Elucidating the neural circuits underlying the BOLD
               signal measured with fMRI is an important goal in human
               neuroscience. One approach is to correlate the amplitude of the
               BOLD signal with the field potential power in different temporal
               frequency bands. However, distinct frequency bands do not always
               correspond to different neural circuits. In visual cortex, field
               potential power in the gamma band consists of at least two
               large, distinct signals arising from distinct neural circuits:
               an oscillatory (narrowband) component and an asynchronous
               (broadband) component. We propose that the oscillatory component
               measures neural synchrony, which is unrelated to BOLD amplitude,
               whereas the broadband component more closely measures the level
               of neural activity, which influences BOLD. METHODS:
               Electrocorticography (ECoG) responses to gratings and noise
               patterns were previously measured in two human subjects in
               V1-V3. Here we measured fMRI responses to the same stimuli. ECoG
               responses were separated into broadband and narrowband
               components; the two components were separately correlated with
               the fMRI response in corresponding cortical regions. RESULTS: In
               V1, the ECoG broadband amplitude was positively and strongly
               correlated with BOLD across stimuli. In contrast, narrowband
               gamma amplitude was unrelated to BOLD. In V2/V3, BOLD was again
               positively correlated with broadband ECoG and unrelated to
               narrowband gamma; in V2/V3, the degree of alpha band suppression
               was also predictive of BOLD. CONCLUSION: In visual cortex, the
               asynchronous broadband component of the field potential is most
               predictive of the BOLD signal. Narrowband gamma oscillations
               appear as large signals in the voltage measurement but are
               uncorrelated with fMRI. The BOLD signal is not caused by, and
               does not correlate with, a particular frequency band in the LFP.
               Rather, it is a function of the level of neural activity, which
               influences the LFP power in many frequency bands, and is best
               indexed by broadband field potentials. Meeting abstract

  abstract  = "It has been suggested that cross-frequency phase-amplitude
               coupling (PAC), particularly in temporal brain structures,
               serves as a neural mechanism for coordinated working memory
               storage. In this magnetoencephalography study, we show that
               during visual working memory maintenance, temporal cortex
               regions, which exhibit enhanced PAC, interact with prefrontal
               cortex via enhanced low-frequency phase synchronization. Healthy
               human participants were engaged in a visual delayed
               match-to-sample task with pictures of natural objects. During
               the delay period, we observed increased spectral power of beta
               (20-28 Hz) and gamma (40-94 Hz) bands as well as decreased power
               of theta/alpha band (7-9 Hz) oscillations in visual sensory
               areas. Enhanced PAC between the phases of theta/alpha and the
               amplitudes of beta oscillations was found in the left inferior
               temporal cortex (IT), an area known to be involved in visual
               object memory. Furthermore, the IT was functionally connected to
               the prefrontal cortex by increased low-frequency phase
               synchronization within the theta/alpha band. Together, these
               results point to a mechanism in which the combination of PAC and
               long-range phase synchronization subserves enhanced large-scale
               brain communication. They suggest that distant brain regions
               might coordinate their activity in the low-frequency range to
               engage local stimulus-related processing in higher frequencies
               via the combination of long-range, within-frequency phase
               synchronization and local cross-frequency PAC. SIGNIFICANCE
               STATEMENT: Working memory maintenance, like other cognitive
               functions, requires the coordinated engagement of brain areas in
               local and large-scale networks. However, the mechanisms by which
               spatially distributed brain regions share and combine
               information remain primarily unknown. We show that the
               combination of long-range, low-frequency phase synchronization
               and local cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling might serve
               as a mechanism to coordinate memory processes across distant
               brain areas. In this study, low-frequency phase synchronization
               between prefrontal and temporal cortex co-occurred with local
               cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling to higher frequencies
               in the latter. By such means, ongoing working memory storage
               taking place in higher frequencies in temporal regions might be
               effectively coordinated by distant frontal brain regions through
               synchronized activity in the low-frequency range.",

              stimulation (TMS) to briefly alter cortical excitability and
              determine whether early visual areas mediate the effect of
              exogenous attention on performance. Observers performed an
              orientation discrimination task. After a peripheral valid,
              neutral, or invalid cue, two cortically magnified gratings were
              presented, one in the stimulated region and the other in the

              two successive TMS pulses around their occipital pole while the

              gain-performance benefits in the valid-cue condition and costs in
              the invalid-cue condition compared with the neutral condition at
              the high contrast levels. Crucially, when the target was
              stimulated, this response gain was eliminated. Therefore, TMS
              extinguished the effect of exogenous attention. These results

               macaques that were made amblyopic by rearing with artificial

               agreement with previous reports, we found that cortical neuronal
               signals driven through the amblyopic eyes were reduced, and that
               cortical neurons were on average more strongly driven by the
               non-amblyopic than by the amblyopic eyes. We analyzed multiunit

  abstract = "The lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) is reliably active during
              working memory (WM) across human and animal models, but the role
              of lPFC in successful WM is under debate. For instance, non-human
              primate (NHP) electrophysiology research finds that lPFC
              circuitry stores WM representations. Human neuroimaging instead
              suggests that lPFC plays a control function over WM content that
              is stored in sensory cortices. These seemingly incompatible WM
              accounts are often confounded by differences in the amount of
              task training and stimulus exposure across studies (i.e., NHPs
              tend to be trained extensively). Here, we test the possibility
              that such long-term training may alter the role of lPFC in WM
              maintenance. We densely sampled WM-related activity across
              learning, in three human participants, using a longitudinal
              functional MRI (fMRI) protocol. Over three months, participants
              trained on (1) a serial reaction time (SRT) task, wherein complex
              fractal stimuli were embedded within probabilistic sequences, and
              (2) a delayed recognition task probing WM for trained or novel
              stimuli. Participants were scanned frequently throughout
              training, to track how WM activity patterns change with repeated
              stimulus exposure and long-term associative learning. WM task
              performance improved for trained (but not novel) fractals and,
              neurally, delay activity significantly increased in distributed
              lPFC voxels across learning. Pattern similarity analyses also
              found that item-level WM representations emerged within lPFC, but
              not in sensory cortices, and lPFC delay activity increasingly
              reflected sequence relationships from the SRT task, even though
              that information was task-irrelevant for WM. These findings
              demonstrate that human lPFC develops stimulus-selective WM
              responses with learning and WM representations are shaped by
              long-term experience. Influences from training and long-term
              memory may reconcile competing accounts of lPFC function during
              WM. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared

              cognitive abilities that substantially vary between individuals.
              Although much is known about how attentional control and working
              memory capacity relate to each other and to constructs like fluid
              intelligence, little is known about how trial-by-trial
              fluctuations in attentional engagement impact trial-by-trial
              working memory performance. Here, we employ a novel whole-report
              memory task that allowed us to distinguish between varying levels
              of attentional engagement in humans performing a working memory
              task. By characterizing low-performance trials, we can
              distinguish between models in which working memory performance
              failures are caused by either (1) complete lapses of attention or
              (2) variations in attentional control. We found that performance
              failures increase with set-size and strongly predict working
              memory capacity. Performance variability was best modeled by an
              attentional control model of attention, not a lapse model. We
              examined neural signatures of performance failures by measuring
              EEG activity while participants performed the whole-report task.
              The number of items correctly recalled in the memory task was
              predicted by frontal theta power, with decreased frontal theta
              power associated with poor performance on the task. In addition,
              we found that poor performance was not explained by failures of
              sensory encoding; the P1/N1 response and ocular artifact rates
              were equivalent for high- and low-performance trials. In all, we
              propose that attentional lapses alone cannot explain individual
              differences in working memory performance. Instead, we find that
              graded fluctuations in attentional control better explain the
              trial-by-trial differences in working memory that we observe.",

  abstract = "There is a consensus that visual working memory (WM) resources
              are sharply limited, but debate persists regarding the simple
              question of whether there is a limit to the total number of items
              that can be stored concurrently. Zhang and Luck (2008) advanced
              this debate with an analytic procedure that provided strong
              evidence for random guessing responses, but their findings can
              also be described by models that deny guessing while asserting a
              high prevalence of low precision memories. Here, we used a whole
              report memory procedure in which subjects reported all items in
              each trial and indicated whether they were guessing with each
              response. Critically, this procedure allowed us to measure memory
              performance for all items in each trial. When subjects were asked
              to remember 6 items, the response error distributions for about 3
              out of the 6 items were best fit by a parameter-free guessing
              model (i.e. a uniform distribution). In addition, subjects'
              self-reports of guessing precisely tracked the guessing rate
              estimated with a mixture model. Control experiments determined
              that guessing behavior was not due to output interference, and
              that there was still a high prevalence of guessing when subjects
              were instructed not to guess. Our novel approach yielded evidence
              that guesses, not low-precision representations, best explain
              limitations in working memory. These guesses also corroborate a
              capacity-limited working memory system - we found evidence that
              subjects are able to report non-zero information for only 3-4
              items. Thus, WM capacity is constrained by an item limit that
              precludes the storage of more than 3-4 individuated feature
              values.",

              ability to internally generate images de novo (i.e., mental
              imagery). Research on mental imagery has to this point focused
              mostly on whether mental images activate early sensory areas,
              with mixed results [5-7]. Recent studies suggest that
              multivariate pattern analysis of neural activity patterns in
              visual regions can reveal content-specific representations during
              cognitive processes, even though overall activation levels are

              (approximately 8-12 Hz) in visual cortex in anticipation of a
              visual target. We show that brief interference by repetitive

              spatial location impairs identification of target visual stimuli

              with the disruption of anticipatory (prestimulus) alpha
              desynchronization and its spatially selective topography in
              parieto-occipital cortex. Finally, the disruption of anticipatory
              alpha rhythms in occipital cortex after right IPS- or right

              seven chunks in short-term memory (STM) tasks. However, that
              number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device
              than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that
              there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three
              to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide
              variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller
              capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in
              analyses of information processing only if the boundary
              conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four
              basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity
              limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information
              overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when
              other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of
              stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance
              discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various
              indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions,
              rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus
              items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms
              that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the
              capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall.
              A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is
              implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The
              pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from
              compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held
              chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall

              could better account for VWM performance, independent of load.
              Across 2 experiments, performance was better predicted by the
              prioritization of memory items (i.e., attention) than by the
              number of items to be remembered (i.e., memory load). This

              minimally attended items could receive a small proportion of

              version of this hypothesis, the relative ``quality'' of these
              patterns should determine the clarity of an individual's memory.
              Here, we provide a direct test of this claim. We used fMRI and a
              forward encoding model to characterize population-level
              orientation-selective responses in visual cortex while human
              participants held an oriented grating in memory. This analysis,
              which enables a precise quantitative description of multivoxel,
              population-level activity measured during working memory storage,
              revealed graded response profiles whose amplitudes were greatest
              for the remembered orientation and fell monotonically as the
              angular distance from this orientation increased. Moreover,
              interparticipant differences in the dispersion-but not the
              amplitude-of these response profiles were strongly correlated
              with performance on a concurrent memory recall task. These

              extent of sensory recruitment. One possibility is that sensory
              recruitment is restricted to neurons that are retinotopically

              Alternatively, specific feature values could be represented via a

              coordinate the cellular assemblies that code the content of WM.
              In line with this view, previous work has demonstrated that
              oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) plays a role in
              WM maintenance, but the exact contributions of this activity have
              remained unclear. Here, we used an inverted spatial encoding
              model in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) to test
              whether the topographic distribution of alpha-band activity
              tracks spatial representations held in WM. Participants in three
              experiments performed spatial WM tasks that required them to
              remember the precise angular location of a sample stimulus for
              1,000-1,750 ms. Across all three experiments, we found that the
              topographic distribution of alpha-band activity tracked the
              specific location that was held in WM. Evoked (i.e., activity
              phase-locked to stimulus onset) and total (i.e., activity
              regardless of phase) power across a range of low-frequency bands
              transiently tracked the location of the sample stimulus following
              stimulus onset. However, only total power in the alpha band
              tracked the content of spatial WM throughout the memory delay

              spatial memory functions of neurons in primate prefrontal cortex.
              Monkeys were trained to fixate a central spot during a brief
              presentation (0.5 s) of a peripheral cue and throughout a
              subsequent delay period (1-6 s), and then, upon the extinction of
              the fixation target, to make a saccadic eye movement to where the
              cue had been presented. Cues were usually presented in one of
              eight different locations separated by 45 degrees. This task thus
              requires monkeys to direct their gaze to the location of a
              remembered visual cue, controls the retinal coordinates of the
              visual cues, controls the monkey's oculomotor behavior during the
              delay period, and also allows precise measurement of the timing
              and direction of the relevant behavioral responses. 2. Recordings
              were obtained from 288 neurons in the prefrontal cortex within
              and surrounding the principal sulcus (PS) while monkeys performed
              this task. An additional 31 neurons in the frontal eye fields
              (FEF) region within and near the anterior bank of the arcuate
              sulcus were also studied. 3. Of the 288 PS neurons, 170 exhibited
              task-related activity during at least one phase of this task and,
              of these, 87 showed significant excitation or inhibition of
              activity during the delay period relative to activity during the
              intertrial interval. 4. Delay period activity was classified as
              directional for 79\% of these 87 neurons in that significant
              responses only occurred following cues located over a certain
              range of visual field directions and were weak or absent for
              other cue directions. The remaining 21\% were omnidirectional,
              i.e., showed comparable delay period activity for all visual
              field locations tested. Directional preferences, or lack thereof,
              were maintained across different delay intervals (1-6 s). 5. For
              50 of the 87 PS neurons, activity during the delay period was
              significantly elevated above the neuron's spontaneous rate for at
              least one cue location; for the remaining 37 neurons only
              inhibitory delay period activity was seen. Nearly all (92\%)
              neurons with excitatory delay period activity were directional
              and few (8\%) were omnidirectional. Most (62\%) neurons with
              purely inhibitory delay period activity were directional, but a
              substantial minority (38\%) was omnidirectional. 6. Fifteen of
              the neurons with excitatory directional delay period activity
              also had significant inhibitory delay period activity for other
              cue directions. These inhibitory responses were usually strongest
              for, or centered about, cue directions roughly opposite those

              This implies that neurons both represent probability
              distributions and combine those distributions according to a
              close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem

              inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this
              variability implies that populations of neurons automatically
              represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of
              code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we

              combinations of populations of neural activity. These results

              reliably across individuals and across species. Similar
              strategies for parcellating higher-order cortex have proven
              elusive. Here, using a novel experimental task and nonlinear

              by characterizing event-related potentials/fields or modulations
              of oscillatory activity (e.g., event-related synchronization) in
              response to cognitively relevant stimuli. Here, we provide a link
              between the two phenomena. An essential component of our theory
              is that peaks and troughs of oscillatory activity fluctuate
              asymmetrically; e.g., peaks are more strongly modulated than
              troughs in response to stimuli. As a consequence, oscillatory
              brain activity will not ``average out'' when multiple trials are
              averaged. Using MEG, we demonstrate that such asymmetric
              amplitude fluctuations of the oscillatory alpha rhythm explain
              the generation of slow event-related fields. Furthermore, we
              provide a physiological explanation for the observed asymmetric

  abstract = "Previous studies from our laboratory identified a parietal eye
              field in the primate lateral intraparietal sulcus, the lateral
              intraparietal area (area LIP). Here we further explore the role
              of area LIP in processing saccadic eye movements by observing the
              effects of reversible inactivation of this area. One to 2 microl
              of muscimol (8 mg/ml) were injected at locations where
              saccade-related activities were recorded for each lesion
              experiment. After the muscimol injection we observed in two
              macaque monkeys consistent effects on both the metrics and
              dynamics of saccadic eye movements at many injection sites. These
              effects usually took place within 10-30 min and disappeared after
              5-6 h in most cases and certainly when tested the next day. After
              muscimol injection memory saccades directed toward the
              contralesional and upper space became hypometric, and in one
              monkey those to the ipsilesional space were slightly but
              significantly hypermetric. In some cases, the scatter of the end
              points of memory saccades was also increased. On the other hand,
              the metrics of visual saccades remained relatively intact.
              Latency for both visual and memory saccades toward the
              contralesional space was increased and in many cases displayed a
              higher variance after muscimol lesion. At many injection sites we
              also observed an increase of latency for visual and memory
              saccades toward the upper space. The peak velocities for memory
              saccades toward the contralesional space were decreased after
              muscimol injection. The peak velocities of visual saccades were
              not significantly different from those of the controls. The
              duration of saccadic eye movements either to the ipsilesional or
              contralesional space remained relatively the same for both visual
              and memory saccades. Overall these results demonstrated that we
              were able to selectively inactivate area LIP and observe effects
              on saccadic eye movements. Together with our previous recording
              studies these results futher support the view that area LIP plays
              a direct role in processing incoming sensory information to
              program saccadic eye movements. The results are consistent with
              our unit recording data and microstimulation studies, which
              suggest that area LIP represents contralateral space and also has
              a bias for the upper visual field.",

               peripheral visual cues, while maintaining fixation on a central
               visual target during the presentation of each cue and during a
               subsequent 1.5-8 sec delay period. Four rhesus monkeys received
               unilateral or serial prefrontal lesions in and around the
               principal sulcus after they reached criterion performance on the
               ODR tasks. Unilateral lesions disrupted the performance of
               memory-guided eye movements to spatial cues in the visual field
               contralateral to the hemisphere in which the lesion was placed.
               Memory-guided eye movements to ipsilateral cues were mildly
               affected by unilateral lesions, and these lesions had little or
               no effect on performance in visually guided control tasks. With
               addition of a second lesion in the opposite hemisphere, the
               deficit was extended to include the opposite hemifield. The
               impairment was characterized by eye movements of inappropriate
               direction, and, excepting the one lesion that extended into the
               frontal eye field region of the arcuate sulcus, saccadic
               reaction times and velocities were the same before and after the
               lesions. The effect of the lesions was delay dependent:
               performance was rarely altered at the shortest (1.5 sec) delay
               but became progressively worse as the delay period was
               lengthened. The present results strengthen the evidence that the
               delayed-response deficits of monkeys with prefrontal lesions are
               caused by failure to maintain a transient memory ``trace'' in
               working memory, and indicate for the first time that working
               memory mechanisms are lateralized: memories for visuo-spatial
               coordinates in each hemifield are processed primarily in the
               contralateral prefrontal cortex. These findings provide evidence
               for the concept of mnemonic hemianopias and mnemonic scotomas,

              we address this limitation by using a model-based approach that
              reconstructs the feature encoded by population activity measured
              with fMRI. Using this approach, we could successfully reconstruct
              the locations of memory-guided saccade goals based on the pattern

              reconstruct the saccade goal even when we dissociated the visual
              stimulus from the saccade goal using a memory-guided antisaccade
              procedure. By comparing the spatiotemporal population dynamics,
              we find that the representations in visual cortex are stable but
              can also evolve from a representation of a remembered visual
              stimulus to a prospective goal. Moreover, because the
              representation of the antisaccade goal cannot be the result of
              bottom-up visual stimulation, it must be evoked by top-down
              signals presumably originating from frontal and/or parietal

              period activity in frontal and parietal cortex correlate with the
              precision with which our model reconstructed the maintained
              saccade goal based on the pattern of activity in visual cortex.
              Therefore, the population dynamics in visual cortex encode WM

               orientation via method of adjustment. Recall errors were smaller
               when the visual field location targeted by TMS overlapped with
               that of the cued memory item, compared to errors for stimuli
               probed diagonally to TMS. This implied topographic storage of
               orientation information, and a memory-enhancing effect at the
               targeted location. Furthermore, early pulses impaired
               performance at all four locations, compared to late pulses.
               Next, response errors were fit empirically using a mixture model
               to characterize memory precision and guess rates. Memory was
               more precise for items proximal to the pulse location,
               irrespective of pulse timing. Guesses were more probable with
               early TMS pulses, regardless of stimulus location. Thus, while
               TMS administered at the offset of the stimulus array might
               disrupt early-phase consolidation in a non-topographic manner,
               TMS also boosts the precise representation of an item at its
               targeted retinotopic location, possibly by increasing
               attentional resources or by injecting a beneficial amount of
               noise.",

               is available for processing. Given its importance in supporting
               a wide-array of high level cognitive abilities, uncovering the
               neural mechanisms that underlie WM has been a primary goal of
               neuroscience research over the past century. Here, we critically
               review what we consider the two major ``arcs'' of inquiry, with
               a specific focus on findings that were theoretically
               transformative. For the first arc, we briefly review classic
               studies that led to the canonical WM theory that cast the
               prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a central player utilizing persistent
               activity of neurons as a mechanism for memory storage. We then
               consider recent challenges to the theory regarding the role of
               persistent neural activity. The second arc, which evolved over
               the last decade, stemmed from sophisticated computational
               neuroimaging approaches enabling researchers to decode the
               contents of WM from the patterns of neural activity in many
               parts of the brain including early visual cortex. We summarize
               key findings from these studies, their implications for WM
               theory, and finally the challenges these findings pose. Our goal
               in doing so is to identify barriers to developing a
               comprehensive theory of WM that will require a unification of
               these two ``arcs'' of research.",

              memory research. CDA amplitude is sensitive to working memory
              load, reaches an asymptote at known behavioral limits, and
              predicts individual differences in capacity. An open question,
              however, is whether neural measures of load also track
              trial-by-trial fluctuations in performance. Here, we used a
              whole-report working memory task to test the relationship between
              CDA amplitude and working memory performance. If working memory
              failures are due to decision-based errors and retrieval failures,
              CDA amplitude would not differentiate good and poor performance
              trials when load is held constant. If failures arise during
              storage, then CDA amplitude should track both working memory load
              and trial-by-trial performance. As expected, CDA amplitude
              tracked load (Experiment 1), reaching an asymptote at three
              items. In Experiment 2, we tracked fluctuations in trial-by-trial
              performance. CDA amplitude was larger (more negative) for
              high-performance trials compared with low-performance trials,
              suggesting that fluctuations in performance were related to the
              successful storage of items. During working memory failures,
              participants oriented their attention to the correct side of the
              screen (lateralized P1) and maintained covert attention to the
              correct side during the delay period (lateralized alpha power

              we found impairments consistent with an executive attention
              theory of individual differences in working memory capacity;
              fluctuations in executive control (indexed by pretrial frontal
              theta power) may be to blame for storage failures.",

               population receptive field (pRF). These methods build on
               conventional visual field mapping that measures responses to
               ring and wedge patterns shown at a series of visual field
               locations and estimates the single position in the visual field
               that produces the largest response. The new method computes a
               model of the population receptive field from responses to a wide
               range of stimuli and estimates the visual field map as well as
               other neuronal population properties, such as receptive field
               size and laterality. The visual field maps obtained with the pRF
               method are more accurate than those obtained using conventional
               visual field mapping, and we trace with high precision the
               visual field maps to the center of the foveal representation. We
               report quantitative estimates of pRF size in medial, lateral and

               localizing ability. Previous modeling studies and empirical data
               suggest that a combination of MEG and EEG signals should yield
               the most accurate localization, due to their complementary

               This allowed direct evaluation of the localization accuracy of

               the localization accuracy of the combined MEG+EEG solution was
               consistently better than that of either modality alone, using
               three different source estimation approaches. Further analysis

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the stability of visual phosphene
               thresholds and to assess whether they correlate with motor
               thresholds. BACKGROUND: Currently, motor threshold is used as an
               index of cortical sensitivity so that in transcranial magnetic
               stimulation (TMS) experiments, intensity can be set at a given
               percentage of this value. It is not known whether this is a
               reasonable index of cortical sensitivity in non-motor and hence
               whether it should be used in experiments where other cortical
               areas are targeted. Previous studies have indicated that
               phosphene threshold might be a suitable alternative in TMS
               studies of the visual system. METHOD: Using single pulse TMS
               visual phosphene and motor thresholds were measured in 15
               subjects. Both thresholds were retested in seven of these
               subjects a week later. RESULT: Visual phosphene thresholds,
               though stable within subjects across the two sessions, showed
               greater variability than motor thresholds. There was no
               correlation between the two measures. CONCLUSION: TMS motor
               thresholds cannot be assumed to be a guide to visual cortex
               excitability and by extension are probably an inappropriate
               guide to the cortical excitability of other non-motor areas of
               the brain. Phosphene thresholds are proposed as a potential
               standard for inter-individual comparison in visual TMS

              may serve as a gating mechanism for flexibly modulating
              communication between brain regions. For this to occur, such

              that also demonstrate time-locked correlations, with time delays
              that match the phase delays of the coherent oscillations. Here,
              by analyzing functional connectivity in both the time and
              frequency domains, we demonstrate that alpha oscillations satisfy
              these constraints and are well suited for modulating
              communication over large spatial scales in the human brain. We
              examine intracranial EEG in the human temporal lobe and find
              robust alpha oscillations that are coherent between brain regions
              with center frequencies that are consistent within each

              are involved in involuntary [3, 4] and even less in voluntary [5]
              reorienting, and their temporal dynamics are unknown. We used
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the occipital cortex
              to interfere with attentional reorienting and study its role and
              temporal dynamics in this process. Human observers performed an
              orientation discrimination task, with either valid or invalid
              attention cueing, across a range of stimulus contrasts. Valid
              cueing induced a behavioral response gain increase, higher

              individualized head models to find the optimal coil placement and

              practical features for prospective planning of TMS interventions
              and retrospective evaluation of the experimental targeting
              accuracy. Approach The TMS targeting and analysis pipeline (TAP)
              software uses an MRI/fMRI-derived brain target to optimize coil
              placement considering experimental parameters such as the
              subject's hair thickness and coil placement restrictions. The
              coil placement optimization is implemented in SimNIBS 3.2, for
              which an additional graphical user interface (TargetingNavigator)
              is provided to visualize/adjust procedural parameters. The coil
              optimization process also computes the E-field at the target,
              allowing the selection of the TMS device intensity setting to
              achieve specific E-field strengths. The optimized coil placement
              information is prepared for neuronavigation software, which
              supports targeting during the TMS procedure. The neuronavigation
              system can record the coil placement during the experiment, and
              these data can be processed in TAP to quantify the accuracy of
              the experimental TMS coil placement and induced E-field. Main
              results TAP was demonstrated in a study consisting of three
              repetitive TMS sessions in five subjects. TMS was delivered by an
              experienced operator under neuronavigation with the
              computationally optimized coil placement. Analysis of the
              experimental accuracy from the recorded neuronavigation data
              indicated coil location and orientation deviations up to about 2
              mm and 2°, respectively, resulting in an 8\% median decrease in
              the target E-field magnitude compared to the optimal placement.

              generalizes to other sensory modalities is a topic of ongoing
              scientific debate. Here, we designed an auditory paradigm
              eliminating any visual input in which participants were required
              to attend to upcoming sounds from one of 24 loudspeakers arranged
              in a horizontal circular array around the head. Maintaining the
              location of an auditory cue was associated with a topographically
              modulated distribution of posterior alpha power resembling the
              findings known from visual attention. Alpha power modulations in
              all electrodes allowed us to predict the sound location in the
              horizontal plane using a forward encoding model. Importantly,
              this prediction was still possible, albeit weaker, when derived
              from the horizontal electrooculogram capturing saccadic behavior.
              We conclude that attending to an auditory target engages
              oculomotor and visual cortical areas in a topographic manner akin
              to the retinotopic organization associated with visual attention

              discharge rates in cortical neurons. When this altered neuronal
              discharge rate, called delay activity, shows stimulus
              specificity, it is a good candidate for a neuronal mechanism of
              working memory. If the delay activity is indeed the carrier of
              memory, then experimental manipulation during the delay period
              that disrupts delay activity should also disrupt behavioral
              performance. We tested this hypothesis in two macaque monkeys
              with a delayed matching-to-sample task (delay time: 8 or 10 s) in
              which only two visual images were used. In each trial, one of the
              images was randomly chosen as the sample. In control trials
              (without disruptive stimulation), the monkeys performed at the
              level of 74.3\% correct recognition. Three electrical stimulation
              levels (mild: a 0.25-s train of electrical pulses; medium: 1-s
              train; strong: 4 s), delivered to the hippocampal formation or to
              the orbito-frontal and inferotemporal cortices during delay
              period, decreased the performance to 71.4, 66.8, and 58.0\%
              respectively (all are significantly less than control
              performance, P < 0.05 for mild stimulation and P < 0.0001 for
              other stimulation levels). Three hundred and thirty-four cells
              were recorded from inferotemporal (211 cells) and prefrontal (123
              cells) cortices. Significant (P < 0.05) stimulus-specific delay

              difference to 20\% (not a statistically significant reduction) in
              trials with mild stimulation, to 14\% (P < 0.05) with medium
              stimulation, and just to 4\% (P < 0.0005) with strong

              neuronal information transfer and retention. Phases along the

              high-excitability states correspond to high-frequency neuronal
              activity and heightened capacity for plasticity induction, as
              demonstrated in animal studies. Human studies corroborate this
              model and suggest a core role of prefrontal theta activity in
              working memory (WM). OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed at modulating
              prefrontal neuronal excitability and WM performance in healthy
              humans, using real-time EEG analysis for triggering repetitive
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) theta-phase synchronized

              underwent 3 different rTMS interventions on separate days, with
              pulses triggered according to the individual's real-time EEG
              activity: 400 rTMS gamma-frequency (100 Hz) triplet bursts
              applied during either the negative peak of the prefrontal theta

              single-pulse TMS, and behavioral effects by using a WM task.
              RESULTS: Negative-peak rTMS increased single-pulse TMS-induced
              prefrontal theta power and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling,
              and decreased WM response time. In contrast, positive-peak rTMS
              decreased prefrontal theta power, while no changes were observed

  abstract = "Cortical areas involved in sensory analysis are also believed to
              be involved in short-term storage of that sensory information.
              Here we investigated whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
              (TMS) can reveal the content of visual short-term memory (VSTM)
              by bringing this information to visual awareness. Subjects were
              presented with two random-dot displays (moving either to the left
              or to the right) and they were required to maintain one of these
              in VSTM. In Experiment 1, TMS was applied over the
              motion-selective area V5/MT+ above phosphene threshold during the
              maintenance phase. The reported phosphene contained motion
              features of the memory item, when the phosphene spatially
              overlapped with memory item. Specifically, phosphene motion was
              enhanced when the memory item moved in the same direction as the
              subjects' V5/MT+ baseline phosphene, whereas it was reduced when
              the motion direction of the memory item was incongruent with that
              of the baseline V5/MT+ phosphene. There was no effect on
              phosphene reports when there was no spatial overlap between the
              phosphene and the memory item. In Experiment 2, VSTM maintenance
              did not influence the appearance of phosphenes induced from the
              lateral occipital region. These interactions between VSTM
              maintenance and phosphene appearance demonstrate that activity in
              V5/MT+ reflects the motion qualities of items maintained in VSTM.
              Furthermore, these results also demonstrate that information in
              VSTM can modulate the pattern of visual activation reaching
              awareness, providing evidence for the view that overlapping
              neuronal populations are involved in conscious visual perception

              support for the view that the stimulation of several different
              visual areas in the occipital lobe may produce phosphenes, it is
              not clear what the contribution of each area is. Here, we studied
              the roles of the primary visual cortex (V1) and the adjacent area

              imaging-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined

              Reports of the subjective visual features of phosphenes were

              stimulation of V1 and V2 are equally capable of generating

              Nevertheless, V1 and V2 contribute differently to brightness:
              neural activation originating in V1 generates a more intense

              detection task in which both CDA and NSW can be measured at the

              Yet, a single image typically triggers neural responses that
              extend beyond 1s. To understand how the brain encodes and
              maintains successive images, we analyzed with
              electroencephalography the brain activity of human subjects while
              they watched ∼5000 visual stimuli presented in fast sequences.
              First, we confirm that each stimulus can be decoded from brain
              activity for ∼1s, and we demonstrate that the brain

              activity in animals including humans. This rhythmic brain
              activity interacts in complex ways with rhythms in the internal

              Some senses, such as touch and vision, sample the environment

              and action exhibit distinct oscillatory phenomena, measured in
              humans by electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). So far,
              the correlative or causal nature of the link between brain
              oscillations and functions has remained elusive. A compelling
              demonstration of causality would primarily generate oscillatory
              signatures that are known to correlate with particular cognitive
              functions and then assess the behavioral consequences. Here, we
              provide the first direct evidence for causal entrainment of brain
              oscillations by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using
              concurrent EEG. RESULTS: We used rhythmic TMS bursts to directly
              interact with an MEG-identified parietal $\alpha$-oscillator,
              activated by attention and linked to perception. With TMS bursts
              tuned to its preferred $\alpha$-frequency ($\alpha$-TMS), we
              confirmed the three main predictions of entrainment of a natural
              oscillator: (1) that $\alpha$-oscillations are induced during
              $\alpha$-TMS (reproducing an oscillatory signature of the
              stimulated parietal cortex), (2) that there is progressive
              enhancement of this $\alpha$-activity (synchronizing the
              targeted, $\alpha$-generator to the $\alpha$-TMS train), and (3)
              that this depends on the pre-TMS phase of the background
              $\alpha$-rhythm (entrainment of natural, ongoing
              $\alpha$-oscillations). Control conditions testing different TMS
              burst profiles and TMS-EEG in a phantom head confirmed
              specificity of $\alpha$-boosting to the case of synchronization
              between TMS train and neural oscillator. CONCLUSIONS: The
              periodic electromagnetic force that is generated during rhythmic
              TMS can cause local entrainment of natural brain oscillations,
              emulating oscillatory signatures activated by cognitive tasks.
              This reveals a new mechanism of online TMS action on brain
              activity and can account for frequency-specific behavioral TMS

                  values. However, the distributional codes explored so far
                  rely on a complex imputation step which crucially relies on
                  spatial non-locality: in order to compute reward prediction
                  errors, units must know not only their own state but also the
                  states of the other units. It is far from clear how these
                  steps could be implemented in realistic neural circuits.
                  Here, we introduce the Laplace code: a local temporal
                  difference code for distributional reinforcement learning
                  that is representationally powerful and computationally
                  straightforward. The code decomposes value distributions and

                  Besides lending itself to a local learning rule, the

                  immediate reward distribution, indicating all possible

  abstract = "Measurement of the T2 distribution in tissues provides
              biologically relevant information about normal and abnormal
              microstructure and organization. Typically, the T2 distribution
              is obtained by fitting the magnitude MR images acquired by a
              multi-echo MRI pulse sequence using an inverse Laplace transform
              (ILT) algorithm. It is well known that the ideal magnitude MR
              signal follows a Rician distribution. Unfortunately, studies
              attempting to establish the validity and efficacy of the ILT
              algorithm assume that these input signals are Gaussian
              distributed. Violation of the normality (or Gaussian) assumption
              introduces unexpected artifacts, including spurious cerebrospinal
              fluid (CSF)-like long T2 components; bias of the true geometric
              mean T2 values and in the relative fractions of various
              components; and blurring of nearby T2 peaks in the T2
              distribution. Here we apply and extend our previously proposed
              magnitude signal transformation framework to map noisy
              Rician-distributed magnitude multi-echo MRI signals into
              Gaussian-distributed signals with high accuracy and precision. We
              then perform an ILT on the transformed data to obtain an accurate
              T2 distribution. Additionally, we demonstrate, by simulations and
              experiments, that this approach corrects the aforementioned
              artifacts in magnitude multi-echo MR images over a large range of
              signal-to-noise ratios.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The inverse Laplace transform (ILT) is the most
              widely used method for T2 relaxometry data analysis. This study
              examines the qualitative agreement of ILT and a proposed
              multiexponential (Mexp method) regarding the number of T2
              components. We performed a feasibility study for the voxelwise
              characterisation of heterogeneous tissue with T2 relaxometry.
              METHODS: Eleven samples of aqueous, fatty and mixed composition
              were analysed using ILT and Mexp. The phantom was imaged using a
              1.5-T system with a single slice T2 relaxometry 25-echo
              Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence in order to obtain the T2
              decay curve with 25 equidistant echo times. The adjusted R2
              goodness of fit criterion was used to determine the number of T2
              components using the Mexp method on a voxel-based analysis.
              Comparison of mean and standard deviation of T2 values for both
              methods was performed by fitting a Gaussian function to the ILT
              resulting vector. RESULTS: Phantom results showed pure
              monoexponential decay for acetone and water and pure
              biexponential behaviour for corn oil, egg yolk, and 35\% fat milk
              cream, while mixtures of egg whites and yolks as well as milk
              creams with 12-20\% fatty composition exhibit mixed
              monoexponential and biexponential behaviour at different
              fractions. The number of T2 components by the Mexp method was
              compared to the ILT-derived spectrum as ground truth.
              CONCLUSIONS: Mexp analysis with the adjusted R2 criterion can be
              used for the detection of the T2 distribution of aqueous, fatty
              and mixed samples with the added advantage of voxelwise mapping.",

              synaptic efficacies endowed with short-term synaptic plasticity.
              To test this idea computationally, we investigated recurrent
              neural network models trained to perform several WM-dependent

              support the short-term maintenance of information, provided that
              the memory delay period is sufficiently short. However, in tasks
              that require actively manipulating information, persistent

              An alternative view is that information can be remembered in a
              flexible format that best suits current behavioral goals. For
              example, remembered visual information might be stored in sensory

              re-coded into a more abstract action-oriented format and stored
              in motor areas. Here, we tested this hypothesis using a

              response was either known or unknown during the memory delay

              are still unclear. In the first part of this study we show that
              the masking effect of TMS differs to masking by light in terms of
              the psychometric function. Here we investigate the emergence of
              phosphenes in relation to perimetric measurements. The coil
              positions were measured with a stereotactic positioning device,
              and stimulation sites were characterized in four subjects on the
              basis of individual retinotopic maps measured by with functional
              magnetic resonance imaging. Phosphene thresholds were found to
              lie a factor of 0.59 below the stimulation intensities required
              to induce visual masking. They covered the segments in the visual
              field where visual suppression occurred with higher stimulation
              intensity. Both phosphenes and transient scotomas were found in
              the lower visual field in the quadrant contralateral to the
              stimulated hemisphere. They could be evoked from a large area
              over the occipital pole. Phosphene contours and texture remained
              quite stable with different coil positions over one hemisphere
              and did not change with the retinotopy of the different visual
              areas on which the coil was focused. They cannot be related
              exclusively to a certain functionally defined visual area. It is
              most likely that both the optic radiation close to its
              termination in the dorsal parts of V1 and back-projecting fibers
              from V2 and V3 back to V1 generate phosphenes and scotomas.",

                  al, which can be summarized as follows. Humans know the
                  uncertainty of their working memory and use it to make
                  decisions; the content and the uncertainty of working memory
                  can be decoded from BOLD signals; decoding errors predict
                  memory errors at the single-trial level; decoded uncertainty
                  correlates with behavioral reports of working memory
                  uncertainty. Later I learned about the findings of Manassi
                  and Whitney about the stability illusion of perceptions
                  making the world look smoothly changing and effectively
                  shifting the perception towards the past. It is not too
                  surprising that the states of feature detector neurons obey a
                  statistical distribution. It is however not obvious that the
                  reliability of the memory should correlate with the width of
                  this distribution and that even the subjective estimate for
                  the reliability should reflect this width. If one accepts the
                  notion of a quantum brain, the distribution of features could
                  reflect the non-determinism of the outcome in the reduction
                  of entanglement quantum measurements producing sensations.
                  Zero energy ontology (ZEO) leads to the notion of 4-D brain
                  and suggests that the feature ensemble is not spatial, as it
                  should be in standard quantum theory, but a temporal ensemble
                  formed by the memory mental images of the feature. Quite
                  generally, in ZEO sequences of ``small'' state function
                  reductions (SSFRs) as counterparts of so called weak
                  measurements would form temporal ensembles of memory mental
                  images so that the connection with short term memory would be
                  direct. This picture explains the findings of both Li et al

              attention to sudden visual events are poorly understood because
              they are tightly intertwined with purely sensory processes. Here
              we isolated visually guided orienting activity from sensory
              activity using event-related potentials (ERPs). By recording ERPs
              to a lateral stimulus and comparing waveforms obtained under
              conditions of attention and inattention, we identified an early
              positive deflection over the ipsilateral visual cortex that was
              associated with the covert orienting of visual attention to the
              stimulus. Across five experiments with male and female adults
              participants, this ipsilateral visual orienting activity (VOA)
              could be distinguished from purely sensory-evoked activity and
              from other top-down spatial attention effects. The VOA was linked
              with behavioral measures of orienting, being significantly larger
              when the stimulus was detected rapidly than when it was detected
              more slowly, and its presence was independent of saccadic eye
              movements towards the targets. The VOA appears to be a specific
              neural index of the visually guided orienting of attention to a
              stimulus that appears abruptly in an otherwise uncluttered visual
              field.Significance Statement:The study of visual attention
              orienting has been an important impetus for the field of
              cognitive neuroscience. Seminal reaction-time studies
              demonstrated that a suddenly appearing visual stimulus attracts
              attention involuntarily, but the neural processes associated with
              visually guided attention orienting have been difficult to
              isolate because they are intertwined with sensory processes that
              trigger the orienting. Here, we disentangled orienting activity
              from sensory activity using scalp recordings of event-related
              electrical activity in the human brain. A specific neural index
              of visually guided attention orienting was identified.
              Surprisingly, whereas peripheral sensory stimulation is processed
              initially and predominantly by the contralateral visual cortex,
              this electrophysiological index of visual orienting was recorded
              over the cerebral hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the
              attention-capturing stimulus.",

              were 60 years or older scheduled for elective radical
              prostatectomy under general anaesthesia. We obtained

              total number of 26 patients completed neuropsychological
              assessments and EEG pre- and postoperatively. Behavioural
              performance declined in the neuropsychological assessment after

              Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.015 d = -0.902), while WM performance

              signatures tracked behavioural performance: Better performance in
              the NP assessment was correlated with an increase of

              cortical activity ( cluster permutation tests: total recall r =
              0.66, p = 0.029, learning slope r = 0.66, p = 0.015), while WM
              accuracy was tracked by distinct temporally-structured
              oscillatory theta/alpha (7 -- 9 Hz), low beta (14 -- 18 Hz) and
              high beta/gamma (34 -- 38 Hz) activity ( cluster permutation

              the time course and neural substrates of each type of orienting,
              these two attention systems are often treated as fundamentally
              distinct. However, recent studies suggest that rhythmic neural
              activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and slow waves in the

              assess whether these neural changes index common processes of
              spatial attention, we conducted two within-subject experiments
              varying the two main dimensions over which endogenous and
              exogenous attention tasks typically differ: cue informativity
              (spatially predictive vs. non-predictive) and cue format
              (centrally vs. peripherally presented). This task design allowed
              us to tease apart neural changes related to top-down goals and
              those driven by the reflexive orienting of spatial attention, and
              examine their interactions in a novel hybrid cross-modal
              attention task. Our data demonstrate that both central and
              peripheral cues elicit lateralized ERPs over parietal-occipital
              cortex, though at different points in time, consistent with these
              ERPs reflecting the orienting of spatial attention. Lateralized
              alpha activity was also present across all tasks, emerging
              rapidly for peripheral cues and sustaining longer for spatially
              informative cues. Overall, these data indicate that distinct
              slow-wave ERPs index the spatial orienting of endogenous and
              exogenous attention, while lateralized alpha activity represents
              a common signature of visual-cortical biasing in anticipation of

  title    = "Fast computational optimization of {TMS} coil placement for
              individualized electric field targeting",
  author   = "Gomez, Luis J and Dannhauer, Moritz and Peterchev, Angel V",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: During transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) a coil
              placed on the scalp is used to non-invasively modulate activity
              of targeted brain networks via a magnetically induced electric
              field (E-field). Ideally, the E-field induced during TMS is
              concentrated on a targeted cortical region of interest (ROI).
              Determination of the coil position and orientation that best
              achieve this objective presently requires a large computational
              effort. OBJECTIVE: To improve the accuracy of TMS we have
              developed a fast computational auxiliary dipole method (ADM) for
              determining the optimum coil position and orientation. The
              optimum coil placement maximizes the E-field along a
              predetermined direction or, alternatively, the overall E-field
              magnitude in the targeted ROI. Furthermore, ADM can assess
              E-field uncertainty resulting from precision limitations of TMS
              coil placement protocols. METHOD: ADM leverages the
              electromagnetic reciprocity principle to compute rapidly the TMS
              induced E-field in the ROI by using the E-field generated by a
              virtual constant current source residing in the ROI. The
              framework starts by solving for the conduction currents resulting
              from this ROI current source. Then, it rapidly determines the
              average E-field induced in the ROI for each coil position by
              using the conduction currents and a fast-multipole method. To
              further speed-up the computations, the coil is approximated using
              auxiliary dipoles enabling it to represent all coil orientations
              for a given coil position with less than 600 dipoles. RESULTS:
              Using ADM, the E-fields generated in an MRI-derived head model
              when the coil is placed at 5900 different scalp positions and 360
              coil orientations per position (over 2.1 million unique
              configurations) can be determined in under 15 min on a standard
              laptop computer. This enables rapid extraction of the optimum
              coil position and orientation as well as the E-field variation
              resulting from coil positioning uncertainty. ADM is implemented
              in SimNIBS 3.2. CONCLUSION: ADM enables the rapid determination
              of coil placement that maximizes E-field delivery to a specific
              brain target. This method can find the optimum coil placement in
              under 15 min enabling its routine use for TMS. Furthermore, it
              enables the fast quantification of uncertainty in the induced
              E-field due to limited precision of TMS coil placement protocols,
              enabling minimization and statistical analysis of the E-field
              dose variability.",

              architecture connection topology. Astrocytes generating calcium
              signals are connected by local gap junction diffusive couplings
              and interact with neurons via chemicals diffused in the
              extracellular space. Calcium elevations occur in response to the
              increased concentration of the neurotransmitter released by
              spiking neurons when a group of them fire coherently. In turn,
              gliotransmitters are released by activated astrocytes modulating
              the strength of the synaptic connections in the corresponding
              neuronal group. Input information is encoded as two-dimensional
              patterns of short applied current pulses stimulating neurons. The
              output is taken from frequencies of transient discharges of
              corresponding neurons. We show how a set of information patterns

              Information retrieval is organized by the application of a cue

              analyzed the dynamical mechanism of WM formation, we discovered

              can successfully store traces of neuronal activations
              corresponding to information patterns. In the retrieval stage,
              the astrocytic network selectively modulates synaptic connections
              in the SNN leading to successful recall. Information and

  abstract = "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a tool for inducing
              transient disruptions of neural activity noninvasively in
              conscious human volunteers. In recent years, the investigative
              domain of TMS has expanded and now encompasses causal
              structure-function relationships across the whole gamut of
              cognitive functions and associated cortical brain regions.
              Consequently, the importance of how to determine the target
              stimulation site has increased and a number of alternative
              methods have emerged. Comparison across studies is precluded
              because different studies necessarily use different tasks, sites,
              TMS conditions, and have different goals. Here, therefore, we
              systematically compare four commonly used TMS coil positioning
              approaches by using them to induce behavioral change in a single
              cognitive study. Specifically, we investigated the behavioral
              impact of right parietal TMS during a number comparison task,
              while basing TMS localization either on (i) individual
              fMRI-guided TMS neuronavigation, (ii) individual MRI-guided TMS
              neuronavigation, (iii) group functional Talairach coordinates, or
              (iv) 10-20 EEG position P4. We quantified the exact behavioral
              effects induced by TMS using each approach, calculated the
              standardized experimental effect sizes, and conducted a
              statistical power analysis in order to calculate the optimal
              sample size required to reveal statistical significance. Our
              findings revealed a systematic difference between the four
              approaches, with the individual fMRI-guided TMS neuronavigation
              yielding the strongest and the P4 stimulation approach yielding
              the smallest behavioral effect size. Accordingly, power analyses
              revealed that although in the fMRI-guided neuronavigation
              approach five participants were sufficient to reveal a
              significant behavioral effect, the number of necessary
              participants increased to n = 9 when employing MRI-guided
              neuronavigation, to n = 13 in case of TMS based on group
              Talairach coordinates, and to n = 47 when applying TMS over P4.
              We discuss these graded effect size differences in light of the

              top-down influences on retinotopic visual cortex, but to date
              neuroimaging methods have only been able to provide indirect
              evidence for such functional interactions between remote but
              interconnected brain regions. Here we combined transcranial
              magnetic stimulation (TMS) with concurrent functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI), plus psychophysics, to show that
              stimulation of the right human frontal eye-field (FEF) produced a
              characteristic topographic pattern of activity changes in
              retinotopic visual areas V1-V4, with functional consequences for
              visual perception. RESULTS: FEF TMS led to activity increases for
              retinotopic representations of the peripheral visual field, but
              to activity decreases for the central field, in areas V1-V4.
              These frontal influences on visual cortex occurred in a top-down
              manner, independently of visual input. TMS of a control site
              (vertex) did not elicit such visual modulations, and saccades,
              blinks, or pupil dilation could not account for our results.
              Finally, the effects of FEF TMS on activity in retinotopic visual
              cortex led to a behavioral prediction that we confirmed
              psychophysically by showing that TMS of the frontal site (again
              compared with vertex) enhanced perceived contrast for peripheral
              relative to central visual stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              provide causal evidence that circuits originating in the human
              FEF can modulate activity in retinotopic visual cortex, in a
              manner that differentiates the central and peripheral visual
              field, with functional consequences for perception. More
              generally, our study illustrates how the new approach of

              processing. To causally investigate FPN-DMN contributions to high
              cognitive demand processing, the current interleaved TMS-fMRI
              study simultaneously manipulated and indexed neural activity
              while tracking cognitive performance during high and low
              cognitive load conditions. METHODS: Twenty participants completed
              an n-back task consisting of four conditions (0-back, 0-backTMS,
              2-back, 2-backTMS) while undergoing interleaved TMS-fMRI. During
              TMS concurrent with n-back blocks, TMS single pulses were
              delivered to the left DLPFC at 100\% motor-threshold every 2.4s.
              RESULTS: TMS delivered during high cognitive load strengthened
              cognitive processing. FPN node activations and DMN node
              deactivations were increased in the high versus low cognitive
              load TMS condition. Contrary to our hypothesis, TMS did not
              increase high load related activation in FPN nodes. However, as
              hypothesized, increased DMN node deactivations emerged as a
              function of TMS during high load (right angular gyrus) and from
              interactions between cognitive load and TMS (right middle
              temporal gyrus). Load and TMS combined to dampen activation
              within the DMN at trend level (p = .058). Deactivation in a
              dorsomedial DMN node was associated with TMS driven improvements
              in high load cognitive processing. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous

  author   = "Contreras, D and Steriade, M",
  abstract = "A slow oscillation (< 1 Hz) has recently been described in
              intracellular recordings from the neocortex and thalamus
              (Steriade et al., 1993c-e). The aim of the present study was to
              determine the phase relations between cortical and thalamic
              neuronal activities during the slow EEG oscillation.
              Intracellular recordings were performed in anesthetized cats from
              neurons in motor and somatosensory cortical areas, the
              rostrolateral sector of the reticular (RE) thalamic nucleus, and
              thalamocortical (TC) cells from ventrolateral (VL) nucleus. The
              EEG was used as time reference for alignment of activities in
              different, simultaneously recorded neurons, including dual
              impalements of cortical cells as well as cortical and TC cells.
              The spontaneous EEG oscillation was characterized by slowly
              recurring (0.3-0.9 Hz) sequences of surface-positive
              (depth-negative) sharp deflections, often followed by oscillatory
              activity within the frequency range of sleep spindles (7-14 Hz)
              or at faster frequencies. Cortical and RE cells were similarly
              hyperpolarized during the depth-positive EEG waves and were
              depolarized during the depth-negative EEG deflections. In many
              instances, the cell depolarization was associated with
              oscillations at the spindle frequency or with tonic firing at
              rates related to the level of depolarization. TC neurons were
              hyperpolarized during the depth-positive EEG waves and displayed
              a series of IPSPs, at the spindle frequencies, during the
              depth-negative EEG waves. Depending on the membrane potential
              (Vm), TC cells could fire spike bursts at the onset of the EEG
              depth-negativity, or their firing could be delayed by subsequent
              IPSPs. The sequence of spontaneous EEG and cellular events
              described above also characterized the responses to cortical and
              thalamic stimulation. Simultaneous intracellular recordings of
              pairs of cortical cells or cortical and TC cells showed that
              spontaneous transitions from less synchronized to more
              synchronized EEG states were marked by a simultaneous
              hyperpolarization, coincident with an overt depth-positive EEG
              wave. We conclude that during low-frequency oscillatory states,
              characteristic of slow-wave sleep, neocortical and thalamic
              neurons display phase relations that are restricted to narrow
              time windows, and that synchronization results from a generalized
              inhibitory phenomenon. Moreover, EEG synchronization is reflected
              as active inhibition in TC neurons. That this pattern is also
              present in states of hypersynchronization, such as seizure
              activity, is shown in the following paper (Steriade and
              Contreras, 1994).",

              high-excitability states. In vitro experiments showed that
              induction of long-term depression (LTD) by low-frequency
              stimulation depends on the postsynaptic excitability state.
              OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We tested the hypothesis that induction of
              LTD-like corticospinal plasticity in humans by 1 Hz repetitive
              TMS (rTMS) is enhanced when rTMS is synchronized with the
              low-excitability state, but decreased or even shifted towards
              long-term (LTP)-like plasticity when synchronized with the
              high-excitability state. METHODS: We applied real-time
              EEG-triggered 1-Hz-rTMS (900 pulses) to the hand area of motor
              cortex in healthy subjects. In a randomized double-blind
              three-condition crossover design, pulses were synchronized to
              either the positive or negative peak of the sensorimotor
              $\mu$-oscillation, or were applied at random phase (control). The
              amplitude of motor evoked potentials was recorded as an index of
              corticospinal excitability before and after 1-Hz-rTMS. RESULTS:
              1-Hz-rTMS at random phase resulted in a trend towards LTD-like
              corticospinal plasticity. RTMS in the positive peak condition
              (i.e., the low-excitability state) induced significant LTD-like
              plasticity. RTMS in the negative peak condition (i.e., the
              high-excitability state) showed a trend towards LTP-like
              plasticity, which was significantly different from the other two
              conditions. CONCLUSION: The level of corticospinal depolarization

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Theta-band neuronal oscillations in the prefrontal
              cortex are associated with several cognitive functions.
              Oscillatory phase is an important correlate of excitability and
              phase synchrony mediates information transfer between neuronal
              populations oscillating at that frequency. The ability to extract
              and exploit the prefrontal theta rhythm in real time in humans
              would facilitate insight into neurophysiological mechanisms of
              cognitive processes involving the prefrontal cortex, and
              development of brain-state-dependent stimulation for therapeutic
              applications. OBJECTIVES: We investigate individual source-space
              beamforming-based estimation of the prefrontal theta oscillation
              as a method to target specific phases of the ongoing theta
              oscillations in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC)
              with real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation
              (TMS). Different spatial filters for extracting the prefrontal
              theta oscillation from EEG signals are compared and additional
              signal quality criteria are assessed to take into account the
              dynamics of this cortical oscillation. METHODS: Twenty two
              healthy participants were recruited for anatomical MRI scans and
              EEG recordings with 18 composing the final analysis. We
              calculated individual spatial filters based on EEG beamforming in
              source space. The extracted EEG signal was then used to simulate
              real-time phase-detection and quantify the accuracy as compared
              to post-hoc phase estimates. Different spatial filters and
              triggering parameters were compared. Finally, we validated the
              feasibility of this approach by actual real-time triggering of
              TMS pulses at different phases of the prefrontal theta
              oscillation. RESULTS: Higher phase-detection accuracy was
              achieved using individualized source-based spatial filters, as
              compared to an average or standard Laplacian filter, and also by
              detecting and avoiding periods of low theta amplitude and periods
              containing a phase reset. Using optimized parameters, prefrontal
              theta-phase synchronized TMS of DMPFC was achieved with an
              accuracy of $\pm$55°. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the
              feasibility of triggering TMS pulses during different phases of
              the ongoing prefrontal theta oscillation in real time. This
              method is relevant for brain state-dependent stimulation in human
              studies of cognition. It will also enable new personalized

              However, determining phase at the time of a stimulus with
              standard signal processing methods is not possible due to the
              stimulus artifact masking the future part of the signal. Here, we
              quantify the degree to which signal-to-noise ratio and
              instantaneous amplitude of the signal affect the variance of
              phase estimation error and the precision with which ``ground

              phosphene thresholds and their relationship to individual
              differences in visual cognition are poorly understood. Here, we
              investigated the neurochemical basis of phosphene perception by
              measuring basal GABA and glutamate levels in primary visual
              cortex using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We further examined
              whether phosphene thresholds would relate to the visuospatial
              phenomenology of grapheme-color synesthesia, a condition
              characterized by atypical binding and involuntary color photisms.
              Phosphene thresholds negatively correlated with glutamate
              concentrations in visual cortex, with lower thresholds associated
              with elevated glutamate. This relationship was robust, present in

              implicated in virtually all brain functions. Although they can be
              described by a prominent peak in the power spectrum, their
              waveform is not necessarily sinusoidal and shows rather complex
              morphology. Both frequency and temporal descriptions of such
              non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations can be utilized. However, in
              non-invasive EEG/MEG recordings the waveform of oscillations
              often takes a sinusoidal shape which in turn leads to a rather
              oversimplified view on oscillatory processes. In this study, we
              show in simulations how spatial synchronization can mask
              non-sinusoidal features of the underlying rhythmic neuronal
              processes. Consequently, the degree of non-sinusoidality can
              serve as a measure of spatial synchronization. To confirm this
              empirically, we show that a mixture of EEG components is indeed
              associated with more sinusoidal oscillations compared to the
              waveform of oscillations in each constituent component. Using
              simulations, we also show that the spatial mixing of the
              non-sinusoidal neuronal signals strongly affects the amplitude
              ratio of the spectral harmonics constituting the waveform.
              Finally, our simulations show how spatial mixing can affect the
              strength and even the direction of the amplitude coupling between
              constituent neuronal harmonics at different frequencies.
              Validating these simulations, we also demonstrate these effects
              in real EEG recordings. Our findings have far reaching

              the benefit from this combination is twofold. Firstly,
              neuroimaging and electrophysiology can inform subsequent NTBS,
              providing the required information to optimize where, when, and

              electrophysiology can provide the readout for neural changes

              the stimulation and ``offline'' NTBS effects outlasting
              plasticity-inducing NTBS protocols can be assessed. Finally, both
              strategies can be combined to close the loop between measuring
              and modulating brain activity by means of closed-loop brain
              state-dependent NTBS. In this paper, we will provide a conceptual
              framework, emphasizing principal strategies and highlighting

              the alpha band, has been implicated in regulating excitability in
              visual areas as a function of anticipatory spatial attention.
              Here we asked whether temporal expectations derived from regular,
              rhythmic events can modulate ongoing oscillatory alpha-band
              activity, so that the changes in cortical excitability are
              focused over the time intervals at which target events are
              expected. The task we used involved making a perceptual
              discrimination about a small target stimulus that reappeared from
              ``behind'' a peripheral occluding band. Temporal expectations
              were manipulated by the regular, rhythmic versus irregular,
              arrhythmic approach of the stimulus toward the occluding band.
              Alpha-band activity was measured during the occlusion period, in
              which no stimulus was presented, but target reappearance was
              anticipated in conditions of high versus low temporal

              expectations. Alpha desynchronization increased rhythmically,
              peaking just before the expected reappearance of target times.
              Analysis of the event-related potentials evoked by the subsequent
              target stimuli showed enhancement of processing at both visual

              possible reasons that working memory performance improves with

              impression that working memory capacity reaches adult levels

              that unlikely explanation, I consider how infant studies may lead

              development of working memory during the school years is also

              connectivity and brain network topology, suggesting they have a
              role in flexibly reconfiguring brain networks in order to adapt
              behavior and cognition to environmental demands. To date,
              however, the relationship between brainstem arousal systems and
              functional connectivity has not been assessed within the context
              of a task with an established relationship between arousal and
              behavior, with most prior studies relying on incidental
              variations in arousal or pharmacological manipulation and static
              brain networks constructed over long periods of time. These
              factors have likely contributed to a heterogeneity of effects
              across studies. To address these issues, we took advantage of the
              association between LC-NE-linked arousal and exploration to probe
              the relationships between exploratory choice, arousal-as measured
              indirectly via pupil diameter-and brain network dynamics.
              Exploration in a bandit task was associated with a shift toward
              fewer, more weakly connected modules that were more segregated in

              Performance on a visual task is often better when target stimuli
              are presented near or at the fovea compared to the retinal
              periphery. For instance, reaction times and error rates are often
              reported to increase with increasing eccentricity. Such findings
              have been interpreted as purely visual, reflecting
              neurophysiological differences in central and peripheral vision,
              as well as attentional, reflecting a central bias in the
              allocation of attentional resources. Other findings indicate that
              in some cases, information from the periphery is preferentially
              processed. Specifically, it has been suggested that visual
              processing speed increases with increasing stimulus eccentricity,
              and that this positive correlation is reduced, but not
              eliminated, when the amount of cortex activated by a stimulus is
              kept constant by magnifying peripheral stimuli (Carrasco et al.,
              2003). In this study, we investigated effects of eccentricity on
              visual attentional capacity with and without magnification, using
              computational modeling based on Bundesen's (1990) theory of
              visual attention. Our results suggest a general decrease in
              attentional capacity with increasing stimulus eccentricity,
              irrespective of magnification. We discuss these results in
              relation to the physiology of the visual system, the use of
              different paradigms for investigating visual perception across
              the visual field, and the use of different stimulus materials

              This manuscript presents several new techniques that make MEA
              spike sorting more robust and accurate. Our pipeline is based on
              an efficient multi-stage ``triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit''
              approach that initially extracts only clean, high-quality
              waveforms from the electrophysiological time series by
              temporarily skipping noisy or ``collided'' events (representing
              two neurons firing synchronously). This is accomplished by
              developing a neural network detection and denoising method
              followed by efficient outlier triaging. The denoised spike
              waveforms are then used to infer the set of spike templates
              through nonparametric Bayesian clustering. We use a
              divide-and-conquer strategy to parallelize this clustering step.
              Finally, we recover collided waveforms with matching-pursuit
              deconvolution techniques, and perform further split-and-merge
              steps to estimate additional templates from the pool of recovered
              waveforms. We apply the new pipeline to data recorded in the
              primate retina, where high firing rates and highly-overlapping
              axonal units provide a challenging testbed for the deconvolution

              receptive fields in this preparation provides a useful quality
              check on any spike sorting pipeline. We show that our pipeline

              expressive language skills. In addition to language deficits, PWA
              are often affected by some level of working memory (WM)
              impairments. Both language and working memory impairments
              combined have a negative impact on PWA's quality of life. The aim
              of this study was to investigate whether the application of
              intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) combined with
              computerized WM training will result in near-ransfer effects
              (i.e., trained WM) and far-transfer effects (i.e., untrained
              language tasks) and have a positive effect on the quality of life
              of PWA. METHODS: The participant was a 63-year-old Greek-Cypriot
              male who presented with mild receptive aphasia and short-term
              memory difficulties. Treatment was carried out using a multiple
              baseline (MB) design composed of a pretherapy or baseline testing
              phase, a therapy phase, and a posttherapy/follow-up phase. The
              treatment program involved iTBS application to the left
              dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area responsible for
              WM, for 10 consecutive sessions. The participant received a
              3-minute iTBS application followed by 30-minute computer-assisted
              WM training. Outcome measures included a WM screening test, a
              standardized aphasia test, a nonverbal intelligence test,
              story-telling speech samples, a procedural discourse task, and a
              questionnaire addressing quality of life. These measures were
              performed three times before the treatment, immediately upon
              completion of the treatment, and once during follow-up testing at
              3 months posttreatment. RESULTS: We found a beneficial effect of

              novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of
              an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those

              that our method was able to reliably produce reconstructions that
              resembled the viewed natural images. A natural image prior
              introduced by a deep generator neural network effectively
              rendered semantically meaningful details to the reconstructions.
              Human judgment of the reconstructions supported the effectiveness
              of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance the visual quality of
              generated images. While our model was solely trained with natural
              images, it successfully generalized to artificial shapes,
              indicating that our model was not simply matching to exemplars.
              The same analysis applied to mental imagery demonstrated
              rudimentary reconstructions of the subjective content. Our
              results suggest that our method can effectively combine
              hierarchical neural representations to reconstruct perceptual and

  abstract = "Encoding models based on deep convolutional neural networks
              (DCNN) predict BOLD responses to natural scenes in the human
              visual system more accurately than many other currently available
              models. However, DCNN-based encoding models fail to predict a
              significant amount of variance in the activity of most voxels in
              all visual areas. This failure could reflect limitations in the
              data (e.g., a noise ceiling), or could reflect limitations of the
              DCNN as a model of computation in the brain. Understanding the
              source and structure of the unexplained variance could therefore
              provide helpful clues for improving models of brain computation.
              Here, we characterize the structure of the variance that
              DCNN-based encoding models cannot explain. Using a publicly
              available dataset of BOLD responses to natural scenes, we
              determined if the source of unexplained variance was shared
              across voxels, individual brains, retinotopic locations, and
              hierarchically distant visual brain areas. We answered these
              questions using voxel-to-voxel (vox2vox) models that predict
              activity in a target voxel given activity in a population of
              source voxels. We found that simple linear vox2vox models
              increased within-subject prediction accuracy over DCNN-based
              models for any pair of source/target visual areas, clearly
              demonstrating that the source of unexplained variance is widely
              shared within and across visual brain areas. However, vox2vox
              models were not more accurate than DCNN-based encoding models
              when source and target voxels came from different brains,
              demonstrating that the source of unexplained variance was not
              shared across brains. Importantly, control analyses demonstrated
              that the source of unexplained variance was not encoded in the
              mean activity of source voxels, or the activity of voxels in
              white matter. Interestingly, the weights of vox2vox models
              revealed preferential connection of target voxel activity to
              source voxels with adjacent receptive fields, even when source
              and target voxels were in different functional brain areas.
              Finally, we found that the prediction accuracy of the vox2vox
              models decayed with hierarchical distance between the source and
              target voxels but showed detailed patterns of dependence on
              hierarchical relationships that we did not observe in DCNNs.
              Given these results, we argue that the structured variance
              unexplained by DCNN-based encoding models is unlikely to be
              entirely caused by non-neural artifacts (e.g., spatially
              correlated measurement noise) or a failure of DCNNs to
              approximate the features encoded in brain activity; rather, our
              results point to a need for brain models that provide both
              mechanistic and computational explanations for structured ongoing

              sensitive techniques for analyzing the information represented in
              BOLD activity. The most popular of these techniques is linear
              classification, a simple technique for decoding information about
              experimental stimuli or tasks from patterns of activity across an
              array of voxels. A more recent development is the voxel-based
              encoding model, which describes the information about the
              stimulus or task that is represented in the activity of single
              voxels. Encoding and decoding are complementary operations:
              encoding uses stimuli to predict activity while decoding uses
              activity to predict information about the stimuli. However, in
              practice these two operations are often confused, and their
              respective strengths and weaknesses have not been made clear.
              Here we use the concept of a linearizing feature space to clarify
              the relationship between encoding and decoding. We show that
              encoding and decoding operations can both be used to investigate
              some of the most common questions about how information is
              represented in the brain. However, focusing on encoding models
              offers two important advantages over decoding. First, an encoding
              model can in principle provide a complete functional description
              of a region of interest, while a decoding model can provide only
              a partial description. Second, while it is straightforward to
              derive an optimal decoding model from an encoding model it is
              much more difficult to derive an encoding model from a decoding
              model. We propose a systematic modeling approach that begins by
              estimating an encoding model for every voxel in a scan and ends
              by using the estimated encoding models to perform decoding.",

              Recent efforts in this direction use neural predictivity, or the
              ability to predict the responses of a biological brain given the
              information in an ANN (such as its internal activations), when
              both are presented with the same stimulus. We propose a new
              approach to quantifying neural predictivity by explicitly mapping
              the activations of an ANN to brain responses with a non-linear
              function, and measuring the error between the predicted and
              actual brain responses. Further, we propose to use a neural
              network to approximate this mapping function by training it on a
              set of neural recordings. The proposed method was implemented
              within the TensorFlow framework and evaluated on a suite of 8
              state-of-the-art image recognition ANNs. Our experiments suggest
              that the use of a non-linear mapping function leads to higher

              recognition ANNs are not matched by improvements in their neural
              predictivity. Finally, we examine the impact of pruning, a widely

              dim-vision luminosity function. With these three corrections, the
              range of 54 to 148 quanta at the cornea becomes as an upper limit
              5 to 14 quanta actually absorbed by the retinal rods. 3. This
              small number of quanta, in comparison with the large number of
              rods (500) involved, precludes any significant two quantum
              absorptions per rod, and means that in order to produce a visual
              effect, one quantum must be absorbed by each of 5 to 14 rods in
              the retina. 4. Because this number of individual events is so
              small, it may be derived from an independent statistical study of
              the relation between the intensity of a light flash and the
              frequency with which it is seen. Such experiments give values of
              5 to 8 for the number of critical events involved at the
              threshold of vision. Biological variation does not alter these
              numbers essentially, and the agreement between the values
              measured directly and those derived from statistical
              considerations is therefore significant. 5. The results clarify
              the nature of the fluctuations shown by an organism in response
              to a stimulus. The general assumption has been that the stimulus
              is constant and the organism variable. The present considerations
              show, however, that at the threshold it is the stimulus which is
              variable, and that the properties of its variation determine the
              fluctuations found between response and stimulus.",

              Phosphenes are an interesting stimulus for the study of the human
              visual system, constituting conscious percepts without visual
              inputs, elicited by neural activation beyond retinal and
              subcortical processing stages in the visual hierarchy. The same
              TMS pulses, applied at threshold intensity phosphene threshold
              (PT), will prompt phosphene reports on half of all trials
              (``P-yes'') but not on the other half (``P-no''). Contrasting
              brain activity (P-yes > P-no) can provide unique information on
              neural mechanisms underlying conscious percepts, as has been
              demonstrated by published EEG studies. Yet to our knowledge no
              articles reporting analogous contrasts with functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI) have been published. Since it seems
              unlikely that such studies have never been performed, this
              straightforward and technically feasible idea may have been
              explored in multiple failed, and unpublished, attempts. Here, we
              argue why such unsuccessful attempts, even small-scale, best be
              shared. We also report our own failed attempt to find
              phosphene-related activity in fMRI. Threshold phosphenes are weak
              percepts, and their detection subjective and difficult. If fMRI
              correlates of phosphenes are obtainable with this contrast,
              small-scale ('pilot') measurements may not be sufficiently
              powerful to detect them. At the same time, due to the challenges
              and costs involved in TMS-fMRI, attempts might not often get
              beyond the piloting stage. We propose that the only way out of

              mechanism thought to be important for protecting memories is the
              reactivation of neuronal activity patterns representing those
              memories. In artificial neural networks, such memory replay can

              alternative deep neural network, variational auto-encoder (VAE),
              as a computational model of the visual cortex. We trained a VAE
              with a five-layer encoder and a five-layer decoder to learn
              visual representations from a diverse set of unlabeled images.
              Using the trained VAE, we predicted and decoded cortical activity
              observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from
              three human subjects passively watching natural videos. Compared
              to CNN, VAE could predict the video-evoked cortical responses
              with comparable accuracy in early visual areas, but relatively
              lower accuracy in higher-order visual areas. The distinction
              between CNN and VAE in terms of encoding performance was
              primarily attributed to their different learning objectives,
              rather than their different model architecture or number of

              convenient strategy for decoding the fMRI activity to reconstruct
              the video input, by first converting the fMRI activity to the
              VAE's latent variables, and then converting the latent variables
              to the reconstructed video frames through the VAE's decoder. This

              similarities between human early visual cortex and a CNN with
              encoder/decoder architecture, trained with self-supervised
              learning to fill occlusions and reconstruct an unseen image.

              orientation, position and object category from activity in visual
              cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple
              stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed
              categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based
              on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same

              develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field
              models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli
              and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe
              the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and

              completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Traditionally, EEG/MEG data are high-pass filtered
              and baseline-corrected to remove slow drifts. Minor deleterious
              effects of high-pass filtering in traditional time-series
              analysis have been well-documented, including temporal
              displacements. However, its effects on time-resolved multivariate
              pattern classification analyses (MVPA) are largely unknown. NEW
              METHOD: To prevent potential displacement effects, we extend an
              alternative method of removing slow drift noise - robust
              detrending - with a procedure in which we mask out all cortical
              events from each trial. We refer to this method as trial-masked
              robust detrending. RESULTS: In both real and simulated EEG data
              of a working memory experiment, we show that both high-pass
              filtering and standard robust detrending create artifacts that
              result in the displacement of multivariate patterns into activity
              silent periods, particularly apparent in temporal generalization
              analyses, and especially in combination with baseline correction.
              We show that trial-masked robust detrending is free from such
              displacements. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Temporal
              displacement may emerge even with modest filter cut-off settings
              such as 0.05 Hz, and even in regular robust detrending. However,
              trial-masked robust detrending results in artifact-free decoding
              without displacements. Baseline correction may unwittingly
              obfuscate spurious decoding effects and displace them to the rest
              of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Decoding analyses benefit from
              trial-masked robust detrending, without the unwanted side effects
              introduced by filtering or regular robust detrending. However,
              for sufficiently clean data sets and sufficiently strong signals,
              no filtering or detrending at all may work adequately.

              preprocessing phase that attempts to remove them or minimize
              their impact. This paper offers a set of useful techniques for
              this purpose: robust detrending, robust rereferencing, outlier
              detection, data interpolation (inpainting), step removal, and
              filter ringing artifact removal. These techniques provide a less
              wasteful alternative to discarding corrupted trials or channels,
              and they are relatively immune to artifacts that disrupt
              alternative approaches such as filtering. Robust detrending
              allows slow drifts and common mode signals to be factored out
              while avoiding the deleterious effects of glitches. Robust
              rereferencing reduces the impact of artifacts on the reference.
              Inpainting allows corrupt data to be interpolated from intact
              parts based on the correlation structure estimated over the
              intact parts. Outlier detection allows the corrupt parts to be

              artifacts that are common with some MEG systems. Ringing removal
              allows the ringing response of the antialiasing filter to
              glitches (steps, pulses) to be suppressed. The performance of the

              the two structures contribute to behavior during various tasks.
              At the same time, it has become clear that hippocampal-prefrontal
              interactions are disrupted in psychiatric disease and may
              contribute to their pathophysiology. These impairments have most
              frequently been observed in schizophrenia, a disease that has
              long been associated with hippocampal and prefrontal dysfunction.
              Studies in animal models of the illness have also begun to relate
              disruptions in hippocampal-prefrontal interactions to the various
              risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms of the illness.
              The goal of this review is to summarize what is known about the
              role of hippocampal-prefrontal interactions in normal brain
              function and compare how these interactions are disrupted in
              schizophrenia patients and animal models of the disease.
              Outstanding questions for future research on the role of
              hippocampal-prefrontal interactions in both healthy brain
              function and disease states are also discussed.",

              a large body of evidence that is inconsistent with this idea.
              Baseline blood flow is adequate to supply oxygen needs even with

              load and affective valence to reveal potential interferences in
              EEG measures. To induce changes in working memory load and
              affective valence, we used a paradigm which combines an N-back
              task (for working memory load manipulation) with a standard
              method to induce affect (affective pictures taken from the
              International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database).
              Subjective ratings showed that the experimental task was

              it used to be widely assumed that information in WM is maintained
              through persistent recurrent activity, recent studies have shown
              that information can be maintained without persistent firing;
              instead, information can be stored in activity-silent states. A
              candidate mechanism underlying this type of storage is short-term
              synaptic plasticity (STSP), by which the strength of connections
              between neurons rapidly changes to encode new information. To
              demonstrate that STSP can lead to functional behavior, we
              integrated STSP by means of calcium-mediated synaptic
              facilitation in a large-scale spiking-neuron model and added a
              decision mechanism. The model was used to simulate a recent study

              gratings had to be maintained in WM, and compared to subsequent

  abstract = "To examine what kind of information task-related activity encodes
              during spatial working memory processes, we analyzed
              single-neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex while two monkeys
              performed two different oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) tasks.
              In the standard ODR task, monkeys were required to make a saccade
              to the cue location after a 3-s delay, whereas in the rotatory
              ODR (R-ODR) task, they were required to make a saccade 90 degrees
              clockwise from the cue location after the 3-s delay. By comparing
              the same task-related activities in these two tasks, we could
              determine whether such activities encoded the location of the
              visual cue or the direction of the saccade. One hundred twenty
              one neurons exhibited task-related activity in relation to at
              least one task event in both tasks. Among them, 41 neurons
              exhibited directional cue-period activity, most of which encoded
              the location of the visual cue. Among 56 neurons with directional
              delay-period activity, 86\% encoded the location of the visual
              cue, whereas 13\% encoded the direction of the saccade. Among 57
              neurons with directional response-period activity, 58\% encoded
              the direction of the saccade, whereas 35\% encoded the location
              of the visual cue. Most neurons whose response-period activity
              encoded the location of the visual cue also exhibited directional
              delay-period activity that encoded the location of the visual cue
              as well. The best directions of these two activities were
              identical, and most of these response-period activities were
              postsaccadic. Therefore this postsaccadic activity can be
              considered a signal to terminate unnecessary delay-period
              activity. Population histograms encoding the location of the
              visual cue showed tonic sustained activation during the delay
              period. However, population histograms encoding the direction of
              the saccade showed a gradual increase in activation during the
              delay period. These results indicate that the transformation from
              visual input to motor output occurs in the dorsolateral
              prefrontal cortex. The analysis using population histograms
              suggests that this transformation occurs gradually during the
              delay period.",

               in the background noise volume appearing instead of S2 (volume

              sensory signals, attentional and executive control of behavior.
              Using a task that placed demands on both sets of neurons, we
              investigated their contribution to working memory for visual
              motion. Monkeys compared the direction of two moving random-dot
              stimuli, sample and test, separated by a brief memory delay.
              Neurons in both areas showed robust direction-selective activity
              during all phases of the task. During the sample, approximately
              60\% of task-related PFC neurons were direction selective, and
              this selectivity emerged 40 ms later than in MT. Unlike MT, the
              PFC responses to sample did not correlate with behavioral
              choices, but their selectivity was modulated by task demands and
              diminished on error trials. Reliable directional signals were
              found in both areas during the memory delay, but these signals
              were transient rather than sustained by neurons of either area.
              Responses to the test in both areas were modulated by the

              matched the sample. This decrease arose in the PFC 100 ms later

              of an external observer with knowledge of a neuron's inputs and
              outputs who is ignorant of the contents of the ``black box'' that
              is the neuron. Here we consider a neuron to be an observer and we
              interpret spikes from the neuron's perspective. We propose both a
              descriptive hypothesis based on physics and logic, and a
              prescriptive hypothesis based on biological optimality. Our
              descriptive hypothesis is that a neuron's membrane excitability
              is ``known'' and the amplitude of a future excitatory
              postsynaptic conductance (EPSG) is ``unknown''. Therefore
              excitability is an expectation of EPSG amplitude and a spike is
              generated only when EPSG amplitude exceeds its expectation
              (``prediction error''). Our prescriptive hypothesis is that a
              diversity of synaptic inputs and voltage-regulated ion channels
              implement ``predictive homeostasis'', working to insure that the
              expectation is accurate. The homeostatic ideal and optimal
              expectation would be achieved when an EPSP reaches precisely to
              spike threshold, so that spike output is exquisitely sensitive to
              small variations in EPSG input. To an external observer who knows
              neither EPSG amplitude nor membrane excitability, spikes would
              appear random if the neuron is making accurate predictions. We
              review experimental evidence that spike probabilities are indeed
              maintained near an average of 0.5 under natural conditions, and
              we suggest that the same principles may also explain why synaptic
              vesicle release appears to be ``stochastic''. Whereas the present
              hypothesis accords with principles of efficient coding dating
              back to Barlow (1961), it contradicts decades of assertions that
              neural activity is substantially ``random'' or ``noisy''. The
              apparent randomness is by design, and like many other examples of
              apparent randomness, it corresponds to the ignorance of external
              macroscopic observers about the detailed inner workings of a

  abstract = "To what extent is the size of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent
              (BOLD) response influenced by factors other than neural activity?
              In a re-analysis of three neuroimaging datasets (male and female
              human participants), we find large systematic inhomogeneities in
              the BOLD response magnitude in primary visual cortex (V1):
              stimulus-evoked BOLD responses, expressed in units of percent
              signal change, are up to 50\% larger along the representation of
              the horizontal meridian than the vertical meridian. To assess
              whether this surprising effect can be interpreted as differences
              in local neural activity, we quantified several factors that
              potentially contribute to the size of the BOLD response. We find
              relationships between BOLD response magnitude and cortical
              thickness, curvature, depth and macrovasculature. These
              relationships are consistently found across subjects and datasets
              and suggest that variation in BOLD response magnitudes across
              cortical locations reflects, in part, differences in anatomy and
              vascularization. To compensate for these factors, we implement a
              regression-based correction method and show that after
              correction, BOLD responses become more homogeneous across V1. The
              correction reduces the horizontal/vertical difference by about
              half, indicating that some of the difference is likely not due to
              neural activity differences. We conclude that interpretation of
              variation in BOLD response magnitude across cortical locations
              should consider the influence of the potential confounding
              factors of thickness, curvature, depth and
              vascularization.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe magnitude of the BOLD
              signal is often used as a surrogate of neural activity, but the
              exact factors that contribute to its strength have not been
              studied on a voxel-wise level. Here, we examined several
              anatomical and measurement-related factors to assess their
              relationship with BOLD signal magnitude. We find that BOLD
              magnitude correlates with cortical anatomy, depth and
              macrovasculature. To remove the contribution of these factors, we
              propose a simple, data-driven correction method that can be used
              in any functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment.
              After accounting for the confounding factors, BOLD magnitude
              becomes more spatially homogenous. Our correction method improves
              the ability to make more accurate inferences about local neural

              Encoding models (EMs), which predict neural responses from known
              features (e.g., stimulus properties), have succeeded in
              circumscribed domains (e.g., visual neuroscience), but
              implementing domain-general EMs that predict brain-wide activity
              for arbitrary tasks has been limited mainly by availability of
              datasets that 1) sufficiently span a large space of psychological
              functions, and 2) are sufficiently annotated with such functions
              to allow robust EM specification. We examine the use of EMs based
              on a formal specification of psychological function, to predict
              cortical activation patterns across a broad range of tasks. We
              utilized the Multi-Domain Task Battery, a dataset in which 24

              every 35 s and engaging in 44 total conditions of diverse
              psychological manipulations. Conditions were annotated by a group
              of experts using the Cognitive Atlas ontology to identify
              putatively engaged functions, and region-wise cognitive EMs
              (CEMs) were fit, for individual subjects, on neocortical
              responses. We found that CEMs predicted cortical activation maps
              of held-out tasks with high accuracy, outperforming a
              permutation-based null model while approaching the noise ceiling
              of the data, without being driven solely by either cognitive or
              perceptual-motor features. Hierarchical clustering on the
              similarity structure of CEM generalization errors revealed
              relationships amongst psychological functions. Spatial
              distributions of feature importances systematically overlapped

              both at the single neuron level in primates, and at a larger
              scale in humans, and have failed to find encoding of stimulus
              information in the PFC during tasks with a substantial working
              memory component. Strong stimulus related information, however,
              was seen in posterior sensory areas. These results suggest that
              delay period activity in the PFC might be better understood not
              as a signature of memory storage per se, but as a top down signal
              that influences posterior sensory areas where the actual working
              memory representations are maintained.",

  abstract = "Inferior temporal (IT) cortex of primates is known to play an
              important role in visual memory. Previous studies of IT neurons
              during performance of working memory tasks have found modulation
              of responses when a current stimulus matched an item in memory;
              however, this effect was lost if other stimuli intervened in the
              retention interval. To examine how IT cortex retains memories
              while new stimuli are activating the cells, we recorded from IT
              neurons while monkeys performed a delayed matching-to-sample
              task, with multiple intervening items between the sample and
              matching test stimulus. About half of the cells responded
              differently to a test stimulus if it matched the sample, and this
              difference was maintained following intervening stimuli. For most
              of the affected cells, the responses to matching stimuli were
              suppressed; however, for a few cells the opposite effect was
              seen. Temporal contiguity alone could not explain the results, as
              there was no modulation of responses when a stimulus on one trial
              was repeated on the next trial. Thus, an active reset mechanism
              appears to restrict the memory comparison to just the stimuli
              presented within a trial. The suppressive effects appear to be
              generated within or before IT cortex since the suppression of
              response to matching stimuli began almost immediately with the
              onset of the visual response. The memory of the sample stimulus
              affected not only the responses to matching stimuli but also
              those to nonmatching stimuli. There was suggestive evidence that
              the more similar a nonmatching stimulus to the sample, the more
              the response was suppressed. About a quarter of the cells showed
              stimulus-selective activity in the delay interval following the
              sample. However, this activity appeared to be eliminated by
              intervening stimuli. Thus, it is unlikely that delay-interval
              activity in IT contributed to the performance of this particular
              version of delayed matching to sample. To determine how much
              information about the match-nonmatch status of the stimulus was
              conveyed by individual neurons, we analyzed the responses with
              discriminant analysis. The responses of an individual IT neuron
              could be used to classify a stimulus as matching or nonmatching
              on about 60\% of the trials. To achieve the same performance as
              the animal would require averaging the responses of a minimum of
              25 IT neurons. There was no evidence that mnemonic information
              was carried by temporal variations in the spike trains. By
              contrast, there was a modest amount of temporal variation in
              sensory responses to different visual stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

              perception and higher cognitive functions, allowing for the
              active maintenance of information about stimuli no longer in
              view. Research suggests that sustained activity in higher-order
              prefrontal, parietal, inferotemporal and lateral occipital areas
              supports visual maintenance, and may account for the limited
              capacity of working memory to hold up to 3-4 items. Because
              higher-order areas lack the visual selectivity of early sensory
              areas, it has remained unclear how observers can remember
              specific visual features, such as the precise orientation of a
              grating, with minimal decay in performance over delays of many
              seconds. One proposal is that sensory areas serve to maintain
              fine-tuned feature information, but early visual areas show
              little to no sustained activity over prolonged delays. Here we
              show that orientations held in working memory can be decoded from
              activity patterns in the human visual cortex, even when overall
              levels of activity are low. Using functional magnetic resonance

              macaque monkeys and compared their activity with the saccadic eye
              movements elicited by microstimulation at the sites of these
              neurons. Saccades could be elicited from electrical stimulation
              in the cortical gray matter of the frontal eye fields with
              currents as small as 10 microA. Low thresholds for eliciting
              saccades were found at the sites of cells with presaccadic
              activity. Presaccadic neurons classified as visuomovement or
              movement were most associated with low (less than 50 microA)
              thresholds. High thresholds (greater than 100 microA) or no
              elicited saccades were associated with other classes of frontal

              saccades and presaccadic neurons, classified as purely visual.
              Throughout the frontal eye fields, the optimal saccade for
              eliciting presaccadic neural activity at a given recording site
              predicted both the direction and amplitude of the saccades that
              were evoked by microstimulation at that site. In contrast, the
              movement fields of postsaccadic cells were usually different from
              the saccades evoked by stimulation at the sites of such cells. We
              defined the low-threshold frontal eye fields as cortex yielding
              saccades with stimulation currents less than or equal to 50
              microA. It lies along the posterior portion of the arcuate sulcus
              and is largely contained in the anterior bank of that sulcus. It
              is smaller than Brodmann's area 8 but corresponds with the union
              of Walker's cytoarchitectonic areas 8A and 45. Saccade amplitude
              was topographically organized across the frontal eye fields.
              Amplitudes of elicited saccades ranged from less than 1 degree to
              greater than 30 degrees. Smaller saccades were evoked from the
              ventrolateral portion, and larger saccades were evoked from the
              dorsomedial portion. Within the arcuate sulcus, evoked saccades
              were usually larger near the lip and smaller near the fundus.
              Saccade direction had no global organization across the frontal
              eye fields; however, saccade direction changed in systematic
              progressions with small advances of the microelectrode, and all
              contralateral saccadic directions were often represented in a

              1998. A typical scene will contain many different objects, few of
              which are relevant to behavior at any given moment. Thus
              attentional mechanisms are needed to select relevant objects for
              visual processing and control over behavior. We examined this
              role of attention in the inferior temporal cortex of macaque
              monkeys, using a visual search paradigm. While the monkey
              maintained fixation, a cue stimulus was presented at the center
              of gaze, followed by a blank delay period. After the delay, an
              array of two to five choice stimuli was presented extrafoveally,
              and the monkey was rewarded for detecting a target stimulus
              matching the cue. The behavioral response was a saccadic eye
              movement to the target in one version of the task and a lever
              release in another. The array was composed of one ``good''
              stimulus (effective in driving the cell when presented alone) and
              one or more ``poor'' stimuli (ineffective in driving the cell
              when presented alone). Most cells showed higher delay activity
              after a good stimulus used as the cue than after a poor stimulus.
              The baseline activity of cells was also higher preceding a good
              cue, if the animal expected it to occur. This activity may depend
              on a top-down bias in favor of cells coding the relevant
              stimulus. When the choice array was presented, most cells showed
              suppressive interactions between the stimuli as well as strong
              attention effects. When the choice array was presented in the
              contralateral visual field, most cells initially responded the
              same, regardless of which stimulus was the target. However,
              within 150-200 ms of array onset, responses were determined by
              the target stimulus. If the target was the good stimulus, the
              response to the array became equal to the response to the good
              stimulus presented alone. If the target was a poor stimulus, the
              response approached the response to that stimulus presented
              alone. Thus the influence of the nontarget stimulus was
              eliminated. These effects occurred well in advance of the
              behavioral response. When the array was positioned with stimuli
              on opposite sides of the vertical meridian, the contralateral
              stimulus appeared to dominate the response, and this dominant
              effect could not be overcome by attention. Overall, the results
              support a ``biased competition'' model of attention, according to
              which 1) objects in the visual field compete for representation
              in the cortex, and 2) this competition is biased in favor of the
              behaviorally relevant object by virtue of ``top-down'' feedback

              same SC neurons recorded during both the reactive and
              memory-delay tasks in two head-unrestrained monkeys. Comparing
              tasks, visual (aligned with target onset) and motor (aligned on
              saccade onset) responses were highly correlated across neurons,
              but the peak response of visual neurons and peak motor responses
              (of both visuomotor (VM) and motor neurons) were significantly
              higher in the reactive task. Receptive field organization was
              generally similar in both tasks. Spatial coding (along a
              Target-Gaze (TG) continuum) was also similar, with the exception
              that pure motor cells showed a stronger tendency to code future
              gaze location in the memory delay task, suggesting a more
              complete transformation. These results suggest that the
              introduction of a trained memory delay alters both the vigor and
              spatial coding of SC visual and motor responses, likely due to a
              combination of saccade suppression signals and greater signal
              noise accumulation during the delay in the memory delay task.",

              the stimulated cortical site only approximately and indirectly.
              Focusing on the motor cortex, we present and validate a novel
              method to reliably determine the effectively stimulated cortical
              site at the individual subject level. The approach combines

              cortex (VOTC) in published reports of 46 patients with a lesion

  author   = "Li, Hsin-Hung and Curtis, Clayton E",
  abstract = "Working memory (WM) depends on the activity of neural populations
              to maintain internal representations of information that are no
              longer available in the environment. The neural population
              dynamics that support WM in the human cortex remain largely
              unexplored. Utilizing fMRI and time-resolved multivariate
              analyses, we found evidence of both stable and dynamic WM
              representations during a classic memory-guided saccade task.
              Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we identified robust
              neural subspaces in early visual, parietal and even frontal
              cortex that were stable throughout the delay period with
              memorized locations organized within a two-dimensional
              representation of visual space. The dynamic subspace, which was
              largely restricted to early visual cortex, had both an early and
              late delay component during which the WM representation changed.
              Leveraging models of the receptive fields of voxels comprising
              each of the visual field maps, we visualized how the dynamic
              population code changed over time. Early in the trial, the
              dynamic code in V1 was dominated by a narrowly tuned activation
              among voxels with receptive fields centered on the location of
              the peripheral memory target. Late in the trial, the dynamic code
              was driven by diffuse activation among voxels with receptive
              fields along a line between the fovea and the peripheral location
              of the target. Together, the timing, shape, and spatial
              distribution of the WM dynamics in early visual cortex suggest
              that the early component encodes feedforward visual inputs, while
              the late component encodes abstracted task-relevant mnemonic
              representations resulting from feedback signals from higher-level
              brain areas. Significance statement Recent empirical evidence of
              neural dynamics during working memory (WM) challenges established
              canonical theories of how WM representations are stored in the
              brain. Utilizing fMRI and time-resolved multivariate analyses, we
              identified both stable WM codes in visual and association cortex,
              as well as changing, dynamic codes in early visual cortex. Each
              of these population codes were composed of low-dimensional
              topological representations of visual space. Characteristics of
              the WM dynamics in early visual cortex suggest that feedback
              signals from higher-brain areas recode sensory inputs into a

              conversion of stimulus-driven signals into internal
              representations that are maintained across seconds-long mnemonic
              delays. Within primate prefrontal cortex (PFC), a critical node
              of the brain's WM network, neurons show stimulus-selective
              persistent activity during WM, but many of them exhibit strong
              temporal dynamics and heterogeneity, raising the questions of
              whether, and how, neuronal populations in PFC maintain stable

              despite complex and heterogeneous temporal dynamics in
              single-neuron activity, PFC activity is endowed with a
              population-level coding of the mnemonic stimulus that is stable

              analyses to hundreds of recorded single neurons from lateral PFC
              of monkeys performing two seminal tasks that demand parametric
              WM: oculomotor delayed response and vibrotactile delayed
              discrimination. We found that the high-dimensional state space of

              many weaker ones. Although this highly skewed distribution of
              connection strengths is observed in diverse cortical areas, its
              functional significance remains unknown: it is not clear how
              connection strength relates to neuronal response properties, nor

              connections between layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in mouse

              unknown. Focusing on one such potentially shared mechanism, we
              tested the hypothesis that selecting an item within WM utilizes
              similar neural mechanisms as selecting a visible item via a shift
              of attention. We used fMRI and machine learning to decode both
              the selection among items visually available and the selection
              among items stored in WM in human subjects (both sexes). Patterns
              of activity in visual, parietal, and to a lesser extent frontal
              cortex predicted the locations of the selected items. Critically,
              these patterns were strikingly interchangeable; classifiers
              trained on data during attentional selection predicted selection
              from WM, and classifiers trained on data during selection from
              memory predicted attentional selection. Using models of voxel

              externally and internally selected items. Our results suggest
              that selecting among perceived items and selecting among items in

              to external stimuli that we see and to internal representations
              of stimuli stored in memory might rely on a common mechanism.
              Supporting this hypothesis, we demonstrated that not only could
              patterns of human brain activity predict which items were
              selected during perception and memory, but that these patterns
              were interchangeable during external and internal selection.
              Additionally, this generalized selection mechanism operates by
              changes in the gains of the neural populations both encoding

              relationship between the hippocampus and the rest of the brain as
              134 participants attempted to suppress unwanted memories during

              activity vectors may have thousands of entries (dimensions), we

              a topologically nontrivial one-dimensional ring. The ring

              movement sleep. This result directly demonstrates that there are
              continuous attractor dynamics and enables powerful inference

              neurons, and have given rise to contrasting viewpoints about the
              neural underpinning of attentive processing. Moreover, there is
              evidence that attentional signals originate from the
              prefrontoparietal working memory network, but precisely how a
              source area of attention interacts with a sensory system remains
              unclear. To address these questions, we investigated a
              biophysically based network model of spiking neurons composed of
              a reciprocally connected loop of two (sensory and working memory)
              networks. We found that a wide variety of physiological phenomena
              induced by selective attention arise naturally in such a system.
              In particular, our work demonstrates a neural circuit that
              instantiates the ``feature-similarity gain modulation
              principle,'' according to which the attentional gain effect on
              sensory neuronal responses is a graded function of the difference
              between the attended feature and the preferred feature of the
              neuron, independent of the stimulus. Furthermore, our model

  abstract = "How learning and memory is achieved in the brain is a central
              question in neuroscience. Key to today's research into
              information storage in the brain is the concept of synaptic
              plasticity, a notion that has been heavily influenced by Hebb's
              (1949) postulate. Hebb conjectured that repeatedly and
              persistently co-active cells should increase connective strength
              among populations of interconnected neurons as a means of storing
              a memory trace, also known as an engram. Hebb certainly was not
              the first to make such a conjecture, as we show in this history.
              Nevertheless, literally thousands of studies into the classical
              frequency-dependent paradigm of cellular learning rules were
              directly inspired by the Hebbian postulate. But in more recent
              years, a novel concept in cellular learning has emerged, where
              temporal order instead of frequency is emphasized. This new
              learning paradigm - known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity
              (STDP) - has rapidly gained tremendous interest, perhaps because
              of its combination of elegant simplicity, biological
              plausibility, and computational power. But what are the roots of
              today's STDP concept? Here, we discuss several centuries of
              diverse thinking, beginning with philosophers such as Aristotle,
              Locke, and Ribot, traversing, e.g., Lugaro's plasticit{\`a} and
              Rosenblatt's perceptron, and culminating with the discovery of
              STDP. We highlight interactions between theoretical and
              experimental fields, showing how discoveries sometimes occurred
              in parallel, seemingly without much knowledge of the other field,
              and sometimes via concrete back-and-forth communication. We point
              out where the future directions may lie, which includes
              interneuron STDP, the functional impact of STDP, its mechanisms
              and its neuromodulatory regulation, and the linking of STDP to

              spike activity of lateral intraparietal cortical neurons. The
              ramping activity appears to reflect temporal accumulation, on a
              timescale of hundreds of milliseconds, of sensory evidence before
              a decision is reached. To elucidate the cellular and circuit
              basis of such integration times, we developed and investigated a
              simplified two-variable version of a biophysically realistic
              cortical network model of decision making. In this model, slow
              time integration can be achieved robustly if excitatory
              reverberation is primarily mediated by NMDA receptors; our model
              with only fast AMPA receptors at recurrent synapses produces
              decision times that are not comparable with experimental

              our ability to visualize specific visual features, as
              higher-order regions lack the selectivity to represent such

              bottom-up-driven signals. Internally generated signals may be

              bottom-up driving connections target layer 4, located in the

              achieved by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and
              electroencephalography (EEG). Spatiotemporally complex and
              long-lasting TMS-EEG evoked potential (TEP) waveforms are
              believed to result from recurrent, re-entrant activity that
              propagates broadly across multiple cortical and subcortical
              regions, dispersing from and later re-converging on, the primary
              stimulation site. However, if we loosely understand the TEP of a
              TMS-stimulated region as the impulse response function of a noisy
              underdamped harmonic oscillator, then multiple later activity
              components (waveform peaks) should be expected even for an
              isolated network node in the complete absence of recurrent
              inputs. Thus emerges a critically important question for basic
              and clinical research on human brain dynamics: what parts of the
              TEP are due to purely local dynamics, what parts are due to
              reverberant, re-entrant network activity, and how can we
              distinguish between the two? To disentangle this, we used
              source-localized TMS-EEG analyses and whole-brain
              connectome-based computational modelling. Results indicated that
              recurrent network feedback begins to drive TEP responses from 100
              ms post-stimulation, with earlier TEP components being
              attributable to local reverberatory activity within the

              neurophysiological parameters additionally indicated an important

              optimal choice behavior. Latterly, it has become clear that
              dopamine does not merely code prediction error size but also
              signals the difference between the expected value of rewards, and
              the value of rewards actually received, which is obtained through

  title    = "Bayesian inference in ring attractor networks",
  author   = "Kutschireiter, Anna and Basnak, Melanie A and Drugowitsch, Jan",
  abstract = "Working memories are thought to be held in attractor networks in
              the brain. These attractors should keep track of the uncertainty
              associated with each memory, so as to weigh it properly against
              conflicting new evidence. However, conventional attractors do not
              represent uncertainty. Here we show how uncertainty could be
              incorporated into an attractor, specifically a ring attractor
              that encodes head direction. First, we introduce the first
              rigorous normative framework (the circular Kalman filter) for
              benchmarking the performance of a ring attractor under conditions
              of uncertainty. Next we show that the recurrent connections
              within a conventional ring attractor can be re-tuned to match
              this benchmark. This allows the amplitude of network activity to
              grow in response to confirmatory evidence, while shrinking in
              response to poor-quality or strongly conflicting evidence. This
              ``Bayesian ring attractor'' performs near-optimal angular path
              integration and evidence accumulation. Indeed, we show that a
              Bayesian ring attractor is consistently more accurate than a
              conventional ring attractor. Moreover, near-optimal performance
              can be achieved without exact tuning of the network connections.
              Finally, we use large-scale connectome data to show that the
              network can achieve near-optimal performance even after we
              incorporate biological constraints. Our work demonstrates how
              attractors can implement a dynamic Bayesian inference algorithm
              in a biologically plausible manner, and it makes testable
              predictions with direct relevance to the head direction system,
              as well as any neural system that tracks direction, orientation,
              or periodic rhythms. Significance Statement Data from human
              subjects as well as animals shows that working memories are
              associated with a sense of uncertainty. Indeed, a sense of
              uncertainty is what allows an observer to properly weigh new
              evidence against their current memory. However, we do not
              understand how the brain tracks uncertainty. Here we describe a
              simple and biologically plausible network model that can track
              the uncertainty associated with a working memory. The
              representation of uncertainty in this model improves the accuracy
              of its working memory, as compared to conventional models,
              because it assigns the proper weight to new conflicting evidence.
              Our model provides a new interpretation for observed fluctuations
              in brain activity, and it makes testable new predictions. \#\#\#

              features and demonstrate its application in extracting TEPs
              across several single- and multi-pulse TMS protocols. As the
              first open-source GUI-based pipeline for TMS-EEG signal
              processing, this toolbox intends to promote the widespread
              utility and standardization of an emerging technology in brain

              and rapidly degrade within 2-3 s after an offset (called the
              ``competition'' among memory items). When a memory load is low (1

              different forms of memory interact. Previous research has shown
              that people rely on working memory (WM) in short-term recognition
              tasks; a common view is that episodic memory (EM) only influences
              performance on these tasks when WM maintenance is disrupted.
              However, retrieval of memories from EM has been widely observed
              during brief periods of quiescence, raising the possibility that
              EM retrievals during maintenance-critically, before a response
              can be prepared-might affect short-term recognition memory
              performance even in the absence of distraction. We hypothesized
              that this influence would be mediated by the lingering presence
              of reactivated EM content in WM. We obtained support for this
              hypothesis in three experiments, showing that delay-period EM
              reactivation introduces incidentally-associated information
              (context) into WM, and that these retrieved associations
              negatively impact subsequent recognition, leading to substitution
              errors (Experiment 1) and slowing of accurate responses
              (Experiment 2). fMRI pattern analysis showed that slowing is
              mediated by the content of EM reinstatement (Experiment 3). These
              results expose a previously hidden influence of EM on WM, raising
              new questions about the adaptive nature of their interaction.",

              clustering on time/frequency transforms of components returned by
              independent component analysis (ICA). Dipole models of fmtheta

              power of fmtheta components varied widely but correlated

              mechanism of controlled behavior, we investigated a
              biologically-based network model of spiking neurons for
              inhibitory control. In contrast to a simple race between pro-
              versus anti-response, our model incorporates a sensorimotor
              remapping module, and an action-selection module endowed with a
              ``Stop'' process through tonic inhibition. Both are under the
              modulation of rule-dependent control. We tested the model by
              applying it to the well known antisaccade task in which one must
              suppress the urge to look toward a visual target that suddenly
              appears, and shift the gaze diametrically away from the target
              instead. We found that the two-stage competition is crucial for
              reproducing the complex behavior and neuronal activity observed
              in the antisaccade task across multiple brain regions. Notably,
              our model demonstrates two types of errors: fast and slow. Fast
              errors result from failing to inhibit the quick automatic
              responses and therefore exhibit very short response times. Slow
              errors, in contrast, are due to incorrect decisions in the
              remapping process and exhibit long response times comparable to
              those of correct antisaccade responses. The model thus reveals a
              circuit mechanism for the empirically observed slow errors and
              broad distributions of erroneous response times in antisaccade.
              Our work suggests that selecting between competing automatic and
              voluntary actions in behavioral control can be understood in
              terms of near-threshold decision-making, sharing a common

              Functional MRI in the targeted regions predicted subsequent TMS

              During predictable blocks, there was enhanced alpha (8 to 14 Hz)

              processing and prestimulus beta (15 to 30 Hz) functional

              Unpredictable stimuli were associated with increases in spiking

              working memory (VWM) resources flexibly across items: the higher
              the importance of an item, the better it is remembered. A
              related, but much less studied question is whether people also
              have control over the total amount of VWM resource allocated to a
              task. Here, we approach this question by testing whether
              increasing monetary incentives results in better overall VWM
              performance. In three experiments, subjects performed a
              delayed-estimation task on the Amazon Turk platform. In the first
              two experiments, four groups of subjects received a bonus payment
              based on their performance, with the maximum bonus ranging from
              $0 to $10 between groups. We found no effect of the amount of
              bonus on intrinsic motivation or on VWM performance in either
              experiment. In the third experiment, reward was manipulated on a
              trial-by-trial basis using a within-subjects design. Again, no

              and imaging evidence has shown co-occurrent activities in
              different brain regions during working memory. To dissect the
              mechanisms behind the emergence of such distributed working

              detailed, data-constrained model of the human brain combining
              multiple sources of large-scale brain data. The model reveals the
              emergence of distributed working memory patterns which rely on
              long-range synaptic projections, differing from classical models
              where working memory emerges due to local recurrent connectivity.
              When compared to existing evidence regarding areas linked to
              working memory, our model explains almost 80\% of the observed

              the neural substrate for storing memories. An experience, Semon
              proposed, activates a subset of cells that undergo off-line,
              persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram.
              Subsequent reactivation of this engram induces memory retrieval.
              Although Semon's contributions were largely ignored in his
              lifetime, new technologies that allow researchers to image and
              manipulate the brain at the level of individual neurons has
              reinvigorated engram research. We review recent progress in
              studying engrams, including an evaluation of evidence for the
              existence of engrams, the importance of intrinsic excitability
              and synaptic plasticity in engrams, and the lifetime of an
              engram. Together, these findings are beginning to define an
              engram as the basic unit of memory.",

              networks to perform tasks that require information maintenance
              over a brief period (i.e., working memory tasks) remains a

              to be more strongly correlated with the LFP than with the MUA as
              a result of the lack of sustained response in the MUA signal.
              Because we found that MUA was as sustained as the LFP, MUA may
              also be correlated with BOLD. On fine timescales, we computed the
              coherence between the LFP and MUA over the frequency range 10-150
              Hz. The LFP and MUA were weakly but significantly coherent
              (∼0.14) in the gamma band (20-90 Hz). The amount of gamma-band
              coherence was correlated with the power in the gamma band of the
              LFP. The data were consistent with the proposal that the LFP and
              MUA are generated in a noisy, resonant cortical network.",

              among the most important techniques for non-invasively studying
              cognition and disease in the human brain. These signals are known
              to originate from cortical neural activity, typically described
              in terms of current dipoles. While the link between cortical
              current dipoles and EEG/MEG signals is relatively well
              understood, surprisingly little is known about the link between
              different kinds of neural activity and the current dipoles
              themselves. Detailed biophysical modeling has played an important
              role in exploring the neural origin of intracranial electric
              signals, like extracellular spikes and local field potentials.
              However, this approach has not yet been taken full advantage of
              in the context of exploring the neural origin of the cortical
              current dipoles that are causing EEG/MEG signals. Here, we
              present a method for reducing arbitrary simulated neural activity
              to single current dipoles. We find that the method is applicable
              for calculating extracranial signals, but less suited for
              calculating intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) signals. We
              demonstrate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for
              investigating the neural origin of EEG/MEG signals. This is done
              through example studies of the single-neuron EEG contribution,
              the putative EEG contribution from calcium spikes, and from
              calculating EEG signals from large-scale neural network
              simulations. We also demonstrate how the simulated current
              dipoles can be used directly in combination with detailed head
              models, allowing for simulated EEG signals with an unprecedented
              level of biophysical details. In conclusion, this paper presents
              a framework for biophysically detailed modeling of EEG and MEG
              signals, which can be used to better our understanding of

  abstract  = "The study of animal behaviour has been dominated by two general
               models. According to the mechanistic stimulus-response model, a
               particular behaviour is either an innate or an acquired habit
               which is simply triggered by the appropriate stimulus. By
               contrast, the teleological model argues that, at least, some
               activities are purposive actions controlled by the current value
               of their goals through knowledge about the instrumental
               relations between the actions and their consequences. The type
               of control over any particular behaviour can be determined by a
               goal revaluation procedure. If the anim al's performance changes
               appropriately following an alteration in the value of the goal
               or reward without further experience of the instrumental
               relationship, the behaviour should be regarded as a purposive
               action. On the other hand, the stimulus-response model is more
               appropriate for an activity whose performance is autonomous of
               the current value of the goal. By using this assay, we have
               found that a simple food-rewarded activity is sensitive to
               reward devaluation in rats following limited but not extended
               training. The development of this behavioural autonomy with
               extended training appears to depend not upon the am ount of
               training per se, but rather upon the fact that the animal no
               longer experiences the correlation between variations in
               performance and variations in the associated consequences during
               overtraining. In agreement with this idea, limited exposure to
               an instrumental relationship that arranges a low correlation
               between performance and reward rates also favours the
               development of behavioural autonomy. Thus, the same activity can
               be either an action or a habit depending upon the type of

              appropriately and efficiently in the future. This predictive
              function of memory provides a new perspective on the classic
              question from memory research of why we remember some things but
              not others. If prediction is a key outcome of memory, then the
              extent to which an item generates a prediction signifies that
              this information already exists in memory and need not be
              encoded. We tested this principle using human intracranial EEG as
              a time-resolved method to quantify prediction in visual cortex
              during a statistical learning task and link the strength of these
              predictions to subsequent episodic memory behavior. Epilepsy
              patients of both sexes viewed rapid streams of scenes, some of
              which contained regularities that allowed the category of the
              next scene to be predicted. We verified that statistical learning
              occurred using neural frequency tagging and measured category
              prediction with multivariate pattern analysis. Although neural
              prediction was robust overall, this was driven entirely by
              predictive items that were subsequently forgotten. Such
              interference provides a mechanism by which prediction can
              regulate memory formation to prioritize encoding of information
              that could help learn new predictive relationships.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT When faced with a new experience, we are rarely at a
              loss for what to do. Rather, because many aspects of the world
              are stable over time, we rely on past experiences to generate
              expectations that guide behavior. Here we show that these
              expectations during a new experience come at the expense of
              memory for that experience. From intracranial recordings of
              visual cortex, we decoded what humans expected to see next in a
              series of photographs based on patterns of neural activity.
              Photographs that generated strong neural expectations were more
              likely to be forgotten in a later behavioral memory test.
              Prioritizing the storage of experiences that currently lead to
              weak expectations could help improve these expectations in future
              encounters.",

  abstract = "A hallmark of working memory is the ability to maintain graded
              representations of both the spatial location and amplitude of a
              memorized stimulus. Previous work has identified a neural
              correlate of spatial working memory in the persistent maintenance
              of spatially specific patterns of neural activity. How such
              activity is maintained by neocortical circuits remains unknown.
              Traditional models of working memory maintain analog
              representations of either the spatial location or the amplitude
              of a stimulus, but not both. Furthermore, although most previous
              models require local excitation and lateral inhibition to
              maintain spatially localized persistent activity stably, the
              substrate for lateral inhibitory feedback pathways is unclear.
              Here, we suggest an alternative model for spatial working memory
              that is capable of maintaining analog representations of both the
              spatial location and amplitude of a stimulus, and that does not
              rely on long-range feedback inhibition. The model consists of a
              functionally columnar network of recurrently connected excitatory
              and inhibitory neural populations. When excitation and inhibition
              are balanced in strength but offset in time, drifts in activity
              trigger spatially specific negative feedback that corrects memory
              decay. The resulting networks can temporally integrate inputs at
              any spatial location, are robust against many commonly considered
              perturbations in network parameters, and, when implemented in a
              spiking model, generate irregular neural firing characteristic of
              that observed experimentally during persistent activity. This
              work suggests balanced excitatory-inhibitory memory circuits

              over very brief delays as measured in tests of working memory

              necessary for WM and the specific processes that it supports
              remain controversial. We propose that the hippocampus supports WM
              by binding together high-precision properties of an event, and we
              test this claim by examining the precision of color-location
              bindings in a visual WM task in which participants report the
              precise color of studied items using a continuous color wheel.
              Amnestic patients with hippocampal damage were significantly
              impaired at retrieving these colors after a 1-s delay, and these
              impairments reflected a reduction in the precision of those

               subject. The second categorization divides memory into three

               store, and the long-term store. Incoming sensory information
               first enters the sensory register, where it resides for a very

               has been alternatively explained by mechanisms of decay,
               displacement, and retroactive interference. Another account of
               recency is based on the idea of variable context (Estes, 1955;
               Mensink \& Raaijmakers, 1989). Such notions are typically cast
               in terms of a randomly fluctuating population of elements

               subjects' mental state. This random context view has recently

               contextual drift. In TCM, retrieved context is an inherently

              transiently at event boundaries. The parsing of ongoing activity

              contents of long-term memory, and to the learning of new
              procedures. Event segmentation might arise as a side effect of an
              adaptive mechanism that integrates information over the recent
              past to improve predictions about the near future.",

  author   = "Abdalaziz, Miral and Redding, Zach V and Fiebelkorn, Ian C",
  abstract = "Selective attention1 is characterized by alternating states
              associated with either attentional sampling or attentional
              shifting, helping to prevent functional conflicts by isolating
              function-specific neural activity in time.2,3,4,5 We hypothesized
              that such rhythmic temporal coordination might also help to
              prevent representational conflicts during working memory.6
              Multiple items can be simultaneously held in working memory, and
              these items can be represented by overlapping neural
              populations.7,8,9 Traditional theories propose that the
              short-term storage of to-be-remembered items occurs through
              persistent neural activity,10,11,12 but when neurons are
              simultaneously representing multiple items, persistent activity
              creates a potential for representational conflicts. In
              comparison, more recent, ``activity-silent'' theories of working
              memory propose that synaptic changes also contribute to
              short-term storage of to-be-remembered items.13,14,15,16
              Transient bursts in neural activity,17 rather than persistent
              activity, could serve to occasionally refresh these synaptic
              changes. Here, we used EEG and response times to test whether
              rhythmic temporal coordination helps to isolate neural activity
              associated with different to-be-remembered items, thereby helping
              to prevent representational conflicts. Consistent with this
              hypothesis, we report that the relative strength of different
              item representations alternates over time as a function of the
              frequency-specific phase. Although RTs were linked to theta (∼6
              Hz) and beta (∼25 Hz) phases during a memory delay, the relative
              strength of item representations only alternated as a function of
              the beta phase. The present findings (1) are consistent with
              rhythmic temporal coordination being a general mechanism for
              preventing functional or representational conflicts during
              cognitive processes and (2) inform models describing the role of

              on processes that unfold after events are initially encoded into
              memory. Post-encoding reactivation and hippocampal-cortical
              interactions are leading candidate mechanisms thought to support
              memory retention and stabilization across hippocampal-cortical
              networks. Although putative consolidation mechanisms have been
              observed during sleep and periods of awake rest, the direct
              causal contribution of awake consolidation mechanisms to later
              behavior is unclear, especially in humans. Moreover, it has been
              argued that observations of putative consolidation processes are
              epiphenomenal and not causally important, yet there are few tools
              to test the functional contribution of these mechanisms in
              humans. Here, we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
              and fMRI to test the role of awake consolidation processes by
              targeting hippocampal interactions with lateral occipital cortex
              (LOC). We applied theta-burst TMS to LOC (and a control site) to
              interfere with an extended window (approximately 30-50 min) after
              memory encoding. Behaviorally, post-encoding TMS to LOC
              selectively impaired associative memory retention compared to
              multiple control conditions. In the control TMS condition, we
              replicated prior reports of post-encoding reactivation and

              awake rest using fMRI. However, post-encoding LOC TMS reduced

              longer present. By targeting and manipulating post-encoding
              neural processes, these findings highlight the direct

              Normalization",
  author   = "Ni, Amy M and Maunsell, John H R",
  abstract = "Although spatial and feature attention have differing effects on
              neuronal responses in visual cortex, it remains unclear why.
              Response normalization has been implicated in both types of
              attention (Carandini and Heeger, 2011), and single-unit studies
              have demonstrated that the magnitude of spatial attention effects
              on neuronal responses covaries with the magnitude of
              normalization effects. However, the relationship between feature
              attention and normalization remains largely unexplored. We
              recorded from individual neurons in the middle temporal area of
              rhesus monkeys using a task that allowed us to isolate the
              effects of feature attention, spatial attention, and
              normalization on the responses of each neuron. We found that the
              magnitudes of neuronal response modulations due to spatial
              attention and feature attention are correlated; however, whereas
              modulations due to spatial attention are correlated with
              normalization strength, those due to feature attention are not.
              Additionally, spatial attention modulations are stronger with
              multiple stimuli in the receptive field, whereas feature
              attention modulations are not. These findings are captured by a
              model in which spatial and feature attention share common
              top-down attention signals that nonetheless result in differing
              sensory neuron response modulations because of a spatially tuned
              sensory normalization mechanism. This model explains previously
              reported commonalities and differences between these two types of
              attention by clarifying the relationship between top-down
              attention signals and sensory normalization. We conclude that
              similar top-down signals to visual cortex can have distinct
              effects on neuronal responses due to distinct interactions with
              sensory mechanisms.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Subjects use attention
              to improve their visual perception in several ways, including by
              attending to a location in space or to a visual feature. Prior
              studies have found both commonalities and differences between the
              effects of spatial and feature attention on neuronal responses in
              visual cortex, although it is unclear what mechanisms could
              explain this range of effects. Normalization, a computation by
              which neuronal responses are modified by stimulus context, has
              been implicated in many neuronal mechanisms throughout the brain.
              Here we propose that normalization provides a simple explanation
              for how spatial and feature attention could share common top-down
              attention signals that still affect sensory neuron responses

              stimulus (Herrmann et al., 2010), as predicted by the
              normalization model of attention (Reynolds \& Heeger, 2009). For
              feature-based attention, unlike spatial attention, the model
              predicts only changes in response gain, regardless of whether the
              featural extent of the attention field is small or large. To test
              this prediction, we measured the contrast dependence of
              feature-based attention. Observers performed an
              orientation-discrimination task on a spatial array of grating
              patches. The spatial locations of the gratings were varied

              locations. Feature-based attention was manipulated with a 75\%
              valid and 25\% invalid pre-cue, and the featural extent of the

              the upcoming grating orientation. Performance accuracy was better
              for valid than for invalid pre-cues, consistent with a change in
              response gain, when the featural extent of the attention field
              was small (low uncertainty) or when it was large (high
              uncertainty) relative to the featural extent of the stimulus.

              single population of PPC neurons that is leveraged in different
              ways. To distinguish these possibilities, we evaluated rat PPC
              neurons recorded during multisensory decisions. Newly designed
              tests revealed that task parameters and temporal response
              features were distributed randomly across neurons, without
              evidence of categories. This suggests that PPC neurons constitute
              a dynamic network that is decoded according to the animal's
              present needs. To test for an additional signature of a dynamic
              network, we compared moments when behavioral demands differed:
              decision and movement. Our new state-space analysis revealed that
              the network explored different dimensions during decision and
              movement. These observations suggest that a single network of
              neurons can support the evolving behavioral demands of
              decision-making.",

              incoming visual information but is also engaged by top-down
              cognitive processes, such as visual working memory, even in the
              absence of visual input [1-3]. This feedback may be critical to
              our ability to visualize specific visual features, as
              higher-order regions lack the selectivity to represent such
              information [4]. Clearly, such internally generated signals do
              not trigger genuine perception of the remembered stimulus,
              meaning they must be organized in a manner that is different to
              bottom-up-driven signals. Internally generated signals may be
              kept separate from incoming sensory data by virtue of the laminar
              organization of inter-area cortical connections. Namely,
              bottom-up driving connections target layer 4, located in the
              middle of the cortical column, and feedback connections target
              deep and superficial layers and avoid layer 4 [5-7]. Using
              lamina-resolved fMRI, we simultaneously measured the activity in
              three early visual cortical areas (V1-V3) that are recruited to
              represent stimulus information during visual working memory [8].
              We observed item-specific working memory signals in early visual
              cortex. In V1, this item-specific activity was selectively
              present at deep and superficial cortical depths, avoiding the

              history, a phenomenon termed adaptation. Prominent theories cast
              adaptation as a consequence of optimized encoding of visual
              information by exploiting the temporal statistics of the world.
              However, this would require the visual system to track the
              history of individual briefly experienced events, within a stream
              of visual input, to build up statistical representations over
              longer timescales. Here, using an openly available dataset from
              the Allen Brain Observatory, we show that neurons in the early
              visual cortex of the mouse indeed maintain long-term traces of
              individual past stimuli that persist despite the presentation of
              several intervening stimuli, leading to long-term and
              stimulus-specific adaptation over dozens of seconds. Long-term
              adaptation was selectively expressed in cortical, but not in
              thalamic, neurons, which only showed short-term adaptation. Early
              visual cortex thus maintains concurrent stimulus-specific memory
              traces of past input, enabling the visual system to build up a
              statistical representation of the world to optimize the encoding
              of new information in a changing environment.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT In the natural world, previous sensory input is
              predictive of current input over multisecond timescales. The
              visual system could exploit these predictabilities by adapting
              current visual processing to the long-term history of visual
              input. However, it is unclear whether the visual system can track
              the history of individual briefly experienced images, within a
              stream of input, to build up statistical representations over
              such long timescales. Here, we show that neurons in early visual
              cortex of the mouse brain exhibit remarkably long-term adaptation
              to brief stimuli, persisting over dozens of seconds, and despite
              the presentation of several intervening stimuli. The visual

              hippocampal-entorhinal system. Although visual thalamic and
              cortical neurons have been shown to be modulated by spatial
              signals during navigation, the exact source of spatially
              modulated neurons within the visual circuit has never been
              identified, and the neural correlate underpinning a visuospatial
              or spatio-visual map remains elusive. To search for direct
              visuospatial and visuodirectional signals, here we record in vivo
              extracellular spiking activity in the secondary visual cortex
              (V2) from freely foraging rats in a naturalistic environment. We
              identify that V2 neurons forms a complete spatio-visual map with
              a wide range of spatial tunings, which resembles the classical
              spatial map that includes the place, head-direction, border, grid
              and conjunctive cells reported in the hippocampal-entorhinal
              network. These spatially tuned V2 neurons display stable
              responses to external visual cues, and are robust with respect to
              non- spatial environmental changes. Spatially and directionally
              tuned V2 neuronal firing persists in darkness, suggesting that
              this spatio-visual map is not completely dependent on visual
              inputs. Identification of functionally distinct spatial cell
              types in visual cortex expands its classical role of information
              coding beyond a retinotopic map of the eye-centered world. \#\#\#

              phase (17 effect sizes) and one regarding the VSTM maintenance
              phase (15 effect sizes), two meta-regressions (32 effect sizes in

              high-resolution brain responses to thousands of naturalistic
              visual stimuli. Because such experiments necessarily involve
              brief stimulus durations and few repetitions of each stimulus,
              achieving sufficient signal-to-noise ratio can be a major
              challenge. We address this challenge by introducing GLMsingle, a
              scalable, user-friendly toolbox available in MATLAB and Python
              that enables accurate estimation of single-trial fMRI responses
              (glmsingle.org). Requiring only fMRI time-series data and a
              design matrix as inputs, GLMsingle integrates three techniques
              for improving the accuracy of trial-wise general linear model
              (GLM) beta estimates. First, for each voxel, a custom hemodynamic
              response function (HRF) is identified from a library of candidate
              functions. Second, cross-validation is used to derive a set of
              noise regressors from voxels unrelated to the experiment. Third,
              to improve the stability of beta estimates for closely spaced
              trials, betas are regularized on a voxel-wise basis using ridge
              regression. Applying GLMsingle to the Natural Scenes Dataset and
              BOLD5000, we find that GLMsingle substantially improves the
              reliability of beta estimates across visually-responsive cortex
              in all subjects. Comparable improvements in reliability are also
              observed in a smaller-scale auditory dataset from the

              tangible benefits for higher-level analyses relevant to systems
              and cognitive neuroscience. We demonstrate that GLMsingle: (i)
              helps decorrelate response estimates between trials nearby in
              time; (ii) enhances representational similarity between subjects
              within and across datasets; and (iii) boosts one-versus-many

              storage, and retrieval of perceptual experiences and learned
              information. Although these are separable processes, they
              continuously interact and influence each other. For example, the
              underlying perceptual features of an image result in large
              consistency in whether people will remember or forget it, and the
              visual similarities that images share can influence how well they
              will be remembered. The exaggeration of visual features, such as
              enlarged eyes on a face, can lead to enhanced memory, and a
              build-up in perceptual experience can also improve memory. In
              addition to perception influencing memory, memory also influences
              perception. Familiarity with an object or object category can
              result in enhanced perceptual processing, or even lead to the
              stimuli ``looking'' different than they otherwise would.
              Additionally, learning a new category of objects changes how we
              perceive its categorical members, and even members of different,
              related categories. Perception and memory are closely intertwined

              external and internal domain remain poorly understood. We
              developed a combined perception and working-memory task to
              investigate and compare the consequence of shifting spatial
              attention within and between domains in the service of a common
              orientation-reproduction task. Participants were sequentially
              cued to attend to items either in working memory or to an
              upcoming sensory stimulation. Stay trials provided a baseline
              condition, repeatedly cueing participants about the same item,
              while shift trials required participants to shift their attention
              to another item within the same or different domain. Validating
              our experimental approach, we found evidence that participants
              shifted attention effectively in either domain. Strikingly, we
              observed greater costs when shifting attention between versus
              within domains. Biases in fixational gaze behaviour tracked
              attentional orienting in both domains but revealed no latency or
              magnitude difference for between- versus within-domain shifts,
              suggesting that the costs of between-domain shifts must arise
              within additional attention functions. Our study and results
              break new ground for exploring this ubiquitous act of shifting
              attention between perception and working memory to guide adaptive
              behaviour in everyday cognition.",

              attentional mechanisms select, modulate, and sustain focus on
              information most relevant for behavior. A significant problem,
              however, is that attention is so ubiquitous that it is unwieldy
              to study. We propose a taxonomy based on the types of information
              that attention operates over--the targets of attention. At the
              broadest level, the taxonomy distinguishes between external
              attention and internal attention. External attention refers to
              the selection and modulation of sensory information. External
              attention selects locations in space, points in time, or
              modality-specific input. Such perceptual attention can also
              select features defined across any of these dimensions, or object
              representations that integrate over space, time, and modality.
              Internal attention refers to the selection, modulation, and
              maintenance of internally generated information, such as task
              rules, responses, long-term memory, or working memory. Working
              memory, in particular, lies closest to the intersection between
              external and internal attention. The taxonomy provides an

  abstract = "Working memory enables the temporary storage of relevant
              information in the service of behavior. Neuroimaging studies have
              suggested that sensory cortex is involved in maintaining contents
              in working memory. This raised the question of how sensory
              regions maintain memory representations during the exposure to
              distracting stimuli. Multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI
              signals in visual cortex has shown that the contents of visual
              working memory could be decoded concurrently with passively
              viewed distractors. The present fMRI study tested whether this
              finding extends to auditory working memory and to active
              distractor processing. We asked participants to memorize the
              pitch of a target sound and to compare it with a probe sound
              presented after a 13 s delay period. In separate conditions, we
              compared a blank delay phase (no distraction) with either passive
              listening to, or active processing of, an auditory distractor
              presented throughout the memory delay. Consistent with previous
              reports, pitch-specific memory information could be decoded in
              auditory cortex during the delay in trials without distraction.
              In contrast, decoding of target sounds in early auditory cortex
              dropped to chance level during both passive and active
              distraction. This was paralleled by memory performance decrements
              under distraction. Extending the analyses beyond sensory cortex
              yielded some evidence for memory content-specific activity in
              inferior frontal and superior parietal cortex during active
              distraction. In summary, while our findings question the
              involvement of early auditory cortex in the maintenance of
              distractor-resistant working memory contents, further research
              should elucidate the role of hierarchically higher
              regions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Information about sensory features
              held in working memory can be read out from hemodynamic activity
              recorded in human sensory cortices. Moreover, visual cortex can
              in parallel store visual content and process newly incoming,
              task-irrelevant visual input. The present study investigated the
              role of auditory cortex for working memory maintenance under
              distraction. While memorized sound frequencies could be decoded
              in auditory cortex in the absence of distraction, auditory
              distraction during the delay phase impaired memory performance
              and prevented decoding of information stored in working memory.
              Apparently, early auditory cortex is not sufficient to represent
              working memory contents under distraction that impairs
              performance. However, exploratory analyses indicated that, under
              distraction, higher-order frontal and parietal regions might
              contribute to content-specific working memory storage.",

              environment in the absence of eye movements. These attentional
              explorations are highly flexible, how they spatially unfold
              depending both on within-trial and across-task contingencies.

              movements displace visual images on the retina and yet the brain
              perceives visual stability, a process called active vision. We
              studied whether active vision is Bayesian. Humans and monkeys
              reported whether an image moved during saccades. We tested
              whether they used prior expectations to account for sensory
              uncertainty in a Bayesian manner. For continuous judgments,
              subjects were Bayesian. For categorical judgments, they were
              anti-Bayesian for uncertainty due to external, image noise but
              Bayesian for uncertainty due to internal, motor-driven noise. A
              discriminative learning model explained the anti-Bayesian effect.
              Therefore, active vision uses both Bayesian and discriminative
              models depending on task requirements (continuous vs.
              categorical) and the source of uncertainty (image noise vs.
              motor-driven noise), suggesting that active perceptual mechanisms

              alpha/low-beta oscillations",
  author   = "Turner, William and Blom, Tessel and Hogendoorn, Hinze",
  abstract = "Hierarchical predictive coding networks are a general model of
              sensory processing in the brain. Under neural delays, these
              networks have been suggested to naturally generate oscillatory
              activity in approximately the alpha frequency range (∼8-12 Hz).
              This suggests that alpha oscillations, a prominent feature of EEG
              recordings, may be a spectral 'fingerprint' of predictive sensory
              processing. Here, we probed this possibility by investigating
              whether oscillations over the visual cortex predictively encode
              visual information. Specifically, we examined whether their power
              carries information about the position of a moving stimulus, in a
              temporally predictive fashion. In two experiments (N = 32, 18
              female; N = 34, 17 female), participants viewed an
              apparent-motion stimulus moving along a circular path, while EEG
              was recorded. To investigate the encoding of stimulus-position
              information, we developed a method of deriving probabilistic
              spatial maps from oscillatory power estimates. With this method,
              we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct the trajectory
              of a moving stimulus from alpha/low-beta oscillations, tracking
              its position even across unexpected motion reversals. We also
              show that future position representations are activated in the
              absence of direct visual input, demonstrating that temporally
              predictive mechanisms manifest in alpha/beta-band oscillations.
              In a second experiment we replicate these findings and show that
              the encoding of information in this range is not driven by visual
              entrainment. By demonstrating that occipital alpha/beta
              oscillations carry stimulus-related information, in a temporally
              predictive fashion, we provide empirical evidence of these
              rhythms as a spectral 'fingerprint' of hierarchical predictive
              processing in the human visual system.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT:'Hierarchical predictive coding' is a general model of
              sensory information processing in the brain. When in silico
              predictive coding models are constrained by neural transmission
              delays, their activity naturally oscillates in roughly the alpha
              range (∼8-12 Hz). Using time-resolved EEG decoding, we show that
              neural rhythms in this approximate range (alpha/low-beta) over
              the human visual cortex predictively encode the position of a
              moving stimulus. From the amplitude of these oscillations we are
              able to reconstruct the stimulus' trajectory, revealing
              signatures of temporally-predictive processing. This provides
              direct neural evidence linking occipital alpha/beta rhythms to
              predictive visual processing, supporting the emerging view of
              such oscillations as a potential spectral 'fingerprint' of
              hierarchical predictive processing in the human visual system.",

              These waves are most often measured using macroscopic methods
              that are unable to assess the local spiking activity underlying
              wave dynamics. Here we investigated the possibility that waves
              may not be travelling at the single neuron scale. We first show
              that sequentially activating two discrete brain areas can appear
              as travelling waves in EEG simulations. We next reproduce these
              results using an analytical model of two sequentially activated
              regions. Using this model, we were able to generate wave-like
              activity with variable directions, velocities, and spatial
              patterns, and to map the discriminability limits between
              travelling waves and modular sequential activations. Finally, we
              investigated the link between field potentials and single neuron
              excitability using large-scale measurements from turtle cortex
              ex-vivo. We found that while field potentials exhibit wave-like
              dynamics, the underlying spiking activity was better described by
              consecutively activated spatially adjacent groups of neurons.
              Taken together, this study suggests caution when interpreting
              phase delay measurements as continuously propagating wavefronts
              in two different spatial scales. A careful distinction between
              modular and wave excitability profiles across scales will be
              critical for understanding the nature of cortical computations.",

              of spontaneous fluctuations (intrinsic timescales) and response
              to task events (seasonal timescales) in addition to selectivity
              to task-relevant signals. These timescales increase
              systematically across the cortical hierarchy, for example, from
              parietal to prefrontal and cingulate cortex, pointing to their
              role in cortical computations. It is currently unknown whether
              these timescales are inherent properties of neurons and/or depend
              on training in a specific task and if the latter, how their
              modulations contribute to task performance. To address these
              questions, we analyzed single-cell recordings within five
              subregions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male macaques before
              and after training on a working-memory task. We found
              fine-grained but opposite gradients of intrinsic and seasonal
              timescales that mainly appeared after training. Intrinsic
              timescales decreased whereas seasonal timescales increased from
              posterior to anterior subregions within both dorsal and ventral

              proportions of neurons that exhibited intrinsic and seasonal

              response selectivity due to training. Finally, task selectivity
              accompanied opposite neural dynamics such that neurons with
              task-relevant selectivity exhibited longer intrinsic and shorter
              seasonal timescales. Notably, neurons with longer intrinsic and
              shorter seasonal timescales exhibited superior population-level
              coding, but these advantages extended to the delay period mainly
              after training. Together, our results provide evidence for
              plastic, fine-grained gradients of timescales within PFC that can
              influence both single-cell and population coding, pointing to the
              importance of these timescales in understanding cognition.",

              deliver a major update to existing knowledge about the most
              elemental building block of visual perception -- orientation
              tuning. Using EEG together with simulations in an approach they
              refer to as ``generative forward modeling'', the authors
              adjudicate between two competing population tuning schemes for
              orientation tuning in visual cortex. They claim that a
              redistribution of orientation tuning curves can explain their
              observed pattern of EEG results, and that this tuning scheme
              embeds a prior of natural image statistics that exhibits a
              previously undiscovered anisotropy between vertical and
              horizontal orientations. If correct, this approach could become
              widely used to find unique neural coding solutions to population
              response data (e.g., from EEG) and to yield a ``true'' population

                 integration of translating objects? Visual motion integration
                 is generally conceived of as a feedforward, hierarchical,
                 information processing. However, feedforward models fail to
                 account for many contextual effects revealed using natural
                 moving stimuli. In particular, a translating object evokes a
                 sequence of transient feedforward responses in the primary
                 visual cortex but also propagations of activity through
                 horizontal and feedback pathways. We investigated how these
                 pathways shape the representation of a translating bar in
                 monkey V1. We show that, for long trajectories, spiking
                 activity builds-up hundreds of milliseconds before the bar
                 enters the neurons' receptive fields. Using VSDI and LFP
                 recordings guided by a phenomenological model of propagation
                 dynamics, we demonstrate that this anticipatory response
                 arises from the interplay between horizontal and feedback
                 networks driving V1 neurons well ahead of their feedforward
                 inputs. This mechanism could subtend several perceptual
                 contextual effects observed with translating
                 objects.HighlightsOur hypothesis is that lateral propagation
                 of activity in V1 contributes to the integration of
                 translating stimuliConsistent with this hypothesis, we find
                 that a translating bar induces anticipatory spiking activity
                 in V1 neurons.A V1 model describes how this anticipation can
                 arise from inter and intra-cortical lateral propagation of
                 activity.The dynamic of VSDi and LFP signals in V1 is
                 consistent with the predictions made by the model.The
                 intra-cortical origin is further confirmed by the fact that a
                 bar moving from the ipsilateral hemifield does not evoke
                 anticipation.Horizontal and feedback input are not only
                 modulatory but can also drive spiking responses in specific
