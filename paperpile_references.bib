              activity during the interval between a transient sensory stimulus
              and a subsequent behavioral response has been identified in many
              cortical and subcortical areas. Such persistent activity is
              thought to reflect the maintenance of working memory
              representations that bridge past events with future contingent
              plans. Indeed, the term persistent activity is sometimes used
              interchangeably with working memory. In this review, we argue
              that persistent activity observed broadly across many cortical
              and subcortical areas reflects not only working memory
              maintenance, but also a variety of other cognitive processes,
              including perceptual and reward-based decision making.",

              the spatial patterns of brain activity in early visual cortex,
              how populations encode WM representations remains unclear. Here,
              we address this limitation by using a model-based approach that
              reconstructs the feature encoded by population activity measured
              with fMRI. Using this approach, we could successfully reconstruct
              the locations of memory-guided saccade goals based on the pattern
              of activity in visual cortex during a memory delay. We could
              reconstruct the saccade goal even when we dissociated the visual
              stimulus from the saccade goal using a memory-guided antisaccade
              procedure. By comparing the spatiotemporal population dynamics,
              we find that the representations in visual cortex are stable but
              can also evolve from a representation of a remembered visual
              stimulus to a prospective goal. Moreover, because the
              representation of the antisaccade goal cannot be the result of
              bottom-up visual stimulation, it must be evoked by top-down
              signals presumably originating from frontal and/or parietal
              cortex. Indeed, we find that trial-by-trial fluctuations in delay
              period activity in frontal and parietal cortex correlate with the
              precision with which our model reconstructed the maintained
              saccade goal based on the pattern of activity in visual cortex.
              Therefore, the population dynamics in visual cortex encode WM
              representations, and these representations can be sculpted by
              top-down signals from frontal and parietal cortex.",

               increasingly experiencing a state of information overload.
               Statistics show that we are interrupted every three minutes
               during the course of the work day. Multitasking between email,
               cell-phone, text messages, and four or five websites while
               listening to an iPod forces the brain to process more and more
               informaton at greater and greater speeds. And yet the human
               brain has hardly changed in the last 40,000 years.Are all these
               high-tech advances overtaxing our Stone Age brains or is the
               constant flood of information good for us, giving our brains the
               daily exercise they seem to crave? In The Overflowing Brain,
               cognitive scientist Torkel Klingberg takes us on a journey into
               the limits and possibilities of the brain. He suggests that we
               should acknowledge and embrace our desire for information and
               mental challenges, but try to find a balance between demand and
               capacity. Klingberg explores the cognitive demands, or
               ``complexity,'' of everyday life and how the brain tries to meet
               them. He identifies different types of attention, such as
               stimulus-driven and controlled attention, but focuses chiefly on
               ``working memory,'' our capacity to keep information in mind for
               short periods of time. Dr Klingberg asserts that working memory
               capacity, long thought to be static and hardwired in the brain,
               can be improved by training, and that the increasing demands on
               working memory may actually have a constructive effect: as
               demands on the human brain increase, so does its capacity.The
               book ends with a discussion of the future of brain development
               and how we can best handle information overload in our everyday
               lives. Klingberg suggests how we might find a balance between
               demand and capacity and move from feeling overwhelmed to deeply

  author    = "Nguyen, Mai and Hermes, Dora and Winawer, Jonathan",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Elucidating the neural circuits underlying the BOLD
               signal measured with fMRI is an important goal in human
               neuroscience. One approach is to correlate the amplitude of the
               BOLD signal with the field potential power in different temporal
               frequency bands. However, distinct frequency bands do not always
               correspond to different neural circuits. In visual cortex, field
               potential power in the gamma band consists of at least two
               large, distinct signals arising from distinct neural circuits:
               an oscillatory (narrowband) component and an asynchronous
               (broadband) component. We propose that the oscillatory component
               measures neural synchrony, which is unrelated to BOLD amplitude,
               whereas the broadband component more closely measures the level
               of neural activity, which influences BOLD. METHODS:
               Electrocorticography (ECoG) responses to gratings and noise
               patterns were previously measured in two human subjects in
               V1-V3. Here we measured fMRI responses to the same stimuli. ECoG
               responses were separated into broadband and narrowband
               components; the two components were separately correlated with
               the fMRI response in corresponding cortical regions. RESULTS: In
               V1, the ECoG broadband amplitude was positively and strongly
               correlated with BOLD across stimuli. In contrast, narrowband
               gamma amplitude was unrelated to BOLD. In V2/V3, BOLD was again
               positively correlated with broadband ECoG and unrelated to
               narrowband gamma; in V2/V3, the degree of alpha band suppression
               was also predictive of BOLD. CONCLUSION: In visual cortex, the
               asynchronous broadband component of the field potential is most
               predictive of the BOLD signal. Narrowband gamma oscillations
               appear as large signals in the voltage measurement but are
               uncorrelated with fMRI. The BOLD signal is not caused by, and
               does not correlate with, a particular frequency band in the LFP.
               Rather, it is a function of the level of neural activity, which
               influences the LFP power in many frequency bands, and is best
               indexed by broadband field potentials. Meeting abstract

              Phosphenes are an interesting stimulus for the study of the human
              visual system, constituting conscious percepts without visual
              inputs, elicited by neural activation beyond retinal and
              subcortical processing stages in the visual hierarchy. The same
              TMS pulses, applied at threshold intensity phosphene threshold
              (PT), will prompt phosphene reports on half of all trials
              (``P-yes'') but not on the other half (``P-no''). Contrasting
              brain activity (P-yes > P-no) can provide unique information on
              neural mechanisms underlying conscious percepts, as has been
              demonstrated by published EEG studies. Yet to our knowledge no
              articles reporting analogous contrasts with functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI) have been published. Since it seems
              unlikely that such studies have never been performed, this

              shared. We also report our own failed attempt to find
              phosphene-related activity in fMRI. Threshold phosphenes are weak
              percepts, and their detection subjective and difficult. If fMRI
              correlates of phosphenes are obtainable with this contrast,
              small-scale ('pilot') measurements may not be sufficiently
              powerful to detect them. At the same time, due to the challenges
              and costs involved in TMS-fMRI, attempts might not often get
              beyond the piloting stage. We propose that the only way out of
              this quandary is the communication and sharing of such

              loss or sparing of certain performance abilities has been shown
              to be attributable to differences in the specific requirements of
              behavioral testing (e.g., spatial vs. non-spatial memoranda)
              along with differences in the specific locations of applied
              ablations (e.g., dorsal vs. ventral prefrontal cortex). Such
              findings, which have accumulated now for over a century, have led
              to widespread acceptance that the dorsolateral and ventrolateral
              aspects of the prefrontal cortex may perform different,
              specialized roles in higher order cognition. Nonetheless, it
              remains unclear and controversial how the lateral prefrontal

              different types of functional specialization of the dorsal and

              answer what is actually being remembered or coded for by this
              activity. To address this fundamental issue, we imaged the human
              brain during maintenance of spatial locations and varied whether
              the memory-guided saccade was selected before or after the delay.
              An oculomotor delayed matching-to-sample task (match) was used to
              measure maintained motor intention because the direction of the
              forthcoming saccade was known throughout the delay. We used a
              nonmatching-to-sample task (nonmatch) in which the saccade was
              unpredictable to measure maintained spatial attention. Oculomotor
              areas were more active during match delays, and posterior
              parietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex were more active
              during nonmatch delays. Additionally, the fidelity of the memory

              mechanisms have been proposed to underlie these effects: (1)
              virtual lesion--TMS suppresses neural signals; (2) preferential
              activation of less active neurons--TMS drives up activity in the
              stimulated area, but active neurons are saturating; (3) noise
              generation--TMS adds random neuronal activity, and its effect
              interacts with stimulus intensity; and (4) noise generation--TMS
              adds random neuronal activity, and its effect depends on TMS
              intensity. Here we explore these hypotheses by investigating the
              effects of TMS on early visual cortex by assessing the contrast
              response function while varying the adaptation state of the
              observers. We tested human participants in an orientation
              discrimination task, in which performance is contingent upon
              contrast sensitivity. Before each trial, neuronal activation of
              visual cortex was altered through contrast adaptation to two
              flickering gratings. In a factorial design, with or without
              adaptation, a single TMS pulse was delivered simultaneously with
              targets of varying contrast. Adaptation decreased contrast
              sensitivity. The effect of TMS on performance was state
              dependent: TMS decreased contrast sensitivity in the absence of
              adaptation but increased it after adaptation. None of the
              proposed mechanisms can account for the results in their
              entirety, in particular, for the facilitatory effect at
              intermediate to high contrasts after adaptation. We propose an
              alternative hypothesis: TMS effects are activity dependent, so
              that TMS suppresses the most active neurons and thereby changes
              the balance between excitation and inhibition.",

              magnetic resonance imaging to identify cortical areas with

              goal of testing if such activity represents visuospatial

              two spatial working memory tasks. During a memory-guided saccade
              (MGS) task, a location was maintained during a delay after which
              a saccade was generated to the remembered location. During a

              importance. In a psychophysical experiment, participants
              remembered the location of four targets with different
              probabilities of being tested after a delay. We then measured
              their memory accuracy of one of the targets. We found that
              participants allocated more resource to memoranda with higher
              priority, but underallocated resource to high- and overallocated
              to low-priority targets relative to the true probability of being
              tested. These results are well explained by a computational model
              in which resource is allocated to minimize expected estimation
              error. We replicated this finding in a second experiment in which
              participants bet on their memory fidelity after making the
              location estimate. The results of this experiment show that
              people have access to and utilize the quality of their memory
              when making decisions. Furthermore, people again allocate
              resource in a way that minimizes memory errors, even in a context
              in which an alternative strategy was incentivized. Our study not
              only shows that people are allocating resource according to
              behavioral relevance, but suggests that they are doing so with
              the aim of maximizing memory accuracy.",

              and then reported the location of one probed item using a
              memory-guided saccade. Importantly, items were not equally
              probable to be probed (0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0), which was indicated

              systematically evaluating a representative sample of research
              conducted using NIBS interventions in neuro-psychiatric
              conditions, and assessing the power these studies achieved, given

              defined keyword combinations. Using reported summary effects of
              the meta-analyses as estimate of the true effects, we calculated
              achieved power of each individual study to detect the effect
              indicated by the corresponding meta-analysis. RESULTS: Findings
              suggest that mean and median powers in the field of NIBS were
              0.50, with a mode at 0.83 (range 0.05-1.00). When analysed
              separately, the median powers were 0.27 for tDCS, 0.70 for TMS
              and 0.97 for ECT. These studies had a mean total sample size of
              22.2 $\pm$ 24.9 subjects and the median reported effect size
              across all studies was 0.61. CONCLUSION: According to our

               consciousness. However, recent empirical studies show that
               unconscious content may be maintained within working memory and
               that complex cognitive computations may be performed on-line.
               This promotes research on the exact relationships between
               consciousness and working memory. Current evidence for working
               memory being a conscious as well as an unconscious process is
               reviewed. Consciousness is shown to be considered a subset of
               working memory by major current theories of working memory.
               Evidence for unconscious elements in working memory is shown to
               come from visual masking and attentional blink paradigms, and
               from the studies of implicit working memory. It is concluded
               that more research is needed to explicate the relationship
               between consciousness and working memory. Future research
               directions regarding the relationship between consciousness and

  abstract = "The precise functional role of the hippocampus remains a topic of
              much debate. The dominant view is that the dorsal (or posterior)

              the ventral (or anterior) hippocampus mediates anxiety-related
              behaviours. However, this 'dichotomy view' may need revision.
              Gene expression studies demonstrate multiple functional domains
              along the hippocampal long axis, which often exhibit sharply
              demarcated borders. By contrast, anatomical studies and
              electrophysiological recordings in rodents suggest that the long
              axis is organized along a gradient. Together, these observations
              suggest a model in which functional long-axis gradients are
              superimposed on discrete functional domains. This model provides

               increasingly employed in human cognitive neurophysiology due to
               their high spatial and temporal resolution. For both researchers
               and clinicians, it is critical to localize electrode positions
               relative to the subject-specific neuroanatomy. In many centers,
               a post-implantation MRI is utilized for electrode detection
               because of its higher sensitivity for surgical complications and
               the absence of radiation. However, magnetic susceptibility
               artifacts surrounding each electrode prohibit unambiguous
               detection of individual electrodes, especially those that are
               embedded within dense grid arrays. Here, we present an efficient
               method to accurately localize intracranial electrode arrays
               based on pre- and post-implantation MR images that incorporates
               array geometry and the individual's cortical surface. Electrodes
               are directly visualized relative to the underlying gyral anatomy
               of the reconstructed cortical surface of individual patients.
               Validation of this approach shows high spatial accuracy of the
               localized electrode positions (mean of 0.96 mm $\pm$ 0.81 mm for
               271 electrodes across 8 patients). Minimal user input, short

               temporal resolutions. We investigated the relationship between
               electric field potentials measured with electrocorticography
               (ECoG) and the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response
               measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
               set out to explain the full set of measurements by modeling the
               underlying neural circuits. RESULTS: ECoG responses in visual
               cortex can be separated into two visually driven components. One
               component is a specific temporal response that follows each
               stimulus contrast reversal (``stimulus locked''); the other
               component is an increase in the response variance
               (``asynchronous''). For electrodes in visual cortex (V1, V2,
               V3), the two measures respond to stimuli in the same region of
               visual space, but they have different spatial summation
               properties. The stimulus-locked ECoG component sums contrast
               approximately linearly across space; spatial summation in the
               asynchronous ECoG component is subadditive. Spatial summation
               measured using BOLD closely matches the asynchronous component.
               We created a neural simulation that accurately captures the main
               features of the ECoG time series; in the simulation, the
               stimulus-locked and asynchronous components arise from different
               neural circuits. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that
               the two ECoG components arise from different neural sources
               within the same cortical region. The spatial summation
               measurements and simulations suggest that the BOLD response
               arises primarily from neural sources that generate the
               asynchronous broadband ECoG component.",

               coupling (PAC), particularly in temporal brain structures,
               serves as a neural mechanism for coordinated working memory
               storage. In this magnetoencephalography study, we show that
               during visual working memory maintenance, temporal cortex
               regions, which exhibit enhanced PAC, interact with prefrontal
               cortex via enhanced low-frequency phase synchronization. Healthy
               human participants were engaged in a visual delayed
               match-to-sample task with pictures of natural objects. During
               the delay period, we observed increased spectral power of beta
               (20-28 Hz) and gamma (40-94 Hz) bands as well as decreased power
               of theta/alpha band (7-9 Hz) oscillations in visual sensory
               areas. Enhanced PAC between the phases of theta/alpha and the
               amplitudes of beta oscillations was found in the left inferior
               temporal cortex (IT), an area known to be involved in visual
               object memory. Furthermore, the IT was functionally connected to
               the prefrontal cortex by increased low-frequency phase
               synchronization within the theta/alpha band. Together, these
               results point to a mechanism in which the combination of PAC and
               long-range phase synchronization subserves enhanced large-scale
               brain communication. They suggest that distant brain regions
               might coordinate their activity in the low-frequency range to
               engage local stimulus-related processing in higher frequencies
               via the combination of long-range, within-frequency phase
               synchronization and local cross-frequency PAC. SIGNIFICANCE
               STATEMENT: Working memory maintenance, like other cognitive
               functions, requires the coordinated engagement of brain areas in
               local and large-scale networks. However, the mechanisms by which
               spatially distributed brain regions share and combine
               information remain primarily unknown. We show that the
               combination of long-range, low-frequency phase synchronization
               and local cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling might serve
               as a mechanism to coordinate memory processes across distant
               brain areas. In this study, low-frequency phase synchronization
               between prefrontal and temporal cortex co-occurred with local
               cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling to higher frequencies
               in the latter. By such means, ongoing working memory storage
               taking place in higher frequencies in temporal regions might be
               effectively coordinated by distant frontal brain regions through
               synchronized activity in the low-frequency range.",

               understood. We recorded simultaneously from large populations of
               neurons in the supragranular layers of areas V1 and V2 in 6
               macaques that were made amblyopic by rearing with artificial
               strabismus or anisometropia, and 1 normally reared control. In
               agreement with previous reports, we found that cortical neuronal
               signals driven through the amblyopic eyes were reduced, and that
               cortical neurons were on average more strongly driven by the
               non-amblyopic than by the amblyopic eyes. We analyzed multiunit
               recordings using standard population decoding methods, and found
               that visual signals from the amblyopic eye, while weakened, were
               not degraded enough to explain the behavioral deficits. Thus
               additional losses must arise in downstream processing. We tested
               the idea that under monocular viewing conditions, only signals
               from neurons dominated by - rather than driven by - the open eye
               might be used. This reduces the proportion of neuronal signals
               available from the amblyopic eye, and amplifies the interocular
               difference observed at the level of single neurons. We conclude
               that amblyopia might arise in part from degradation in the
               neuronal signals from the amblyopic eye, and in part from a
               reduction in the number of signals processed by downstream

               stereotactic target for the majority of recent gene therapy
               clinical trials has been the human putamen. The stereotactic
               delivery of therapeutic agents into putamen (or other
               subcortical structures) via CED remains problematic due to the
               difficulty in knowing what volume of therapeutic agent to
               deliver. Preclinical studies in non-human primates (NHP) offer a
               way to model treatment strategies prior to clinical trials.
               Understanding more accurately the volumetric differences in
               striatum, especially putamen, between NHP and humans is
               essential in predicting convective volume parameters in human
               clinical trials. In this study, magnetic resonance images (MRI)
               were obtained for volumetric measurements of striatum (putamen
               and caudate nucleus) and whole brain from 11 PD patients, 13
               aged healthy human subjects, as well as 8 parkinsonian and 30

              working memory (WM) across human and animal models, but the role
              of lPFC in successful WM is under debate. For instance, non-human
              primate (NHP) electrophysiology research finds that lPFC
              circuitry stores WM representations. Human neuroimaging instead
              suggests that lPFC plays a control function over WM content that
              is stored in sensory cortices. These seemingly incompatible WM
              accounts are often confounded by differences in the amount of
              task training and stimulus exposure across studies (i.e., NHPs
              tend to be trained extensively). Here, we test the possibility
              that such long-term training may alter the role of lPFC in WM
              maintenance. We densely sampled WM-related activity across
              learning, in three human participants, using a longitudinal
              functional MRI (fMRI) protocol. Over three months, participants
              trained on (1) a serial reaction time (SRT) task, wherein complex
              fractal stimuli were embedded within probabilistic sequences, and
              (2) a delayed recognition task probing WM for trained or novel
              stimuli. Participants were scanned frequently throughout
              training, to track how WM activity patterns change with repeated
              stimulus exposure and long-term associative learning. WM task
              performance improved for trained (but not novel) fractals and,
              neurally, delay activity significantly increased in distributed
              lPFC voxels across learning. Pattern similarity analyses also
              found that item-level WM representations emerged within lPFC, but
              not in sensory cortices, and lPFC delay activity increasingly
              reflected sequence relationships from the SRT task, even though
              that information was task-irrelevant for WM. These findings
              demonstrate that human lPFC develops stimulus-selective WM
              responses with learning and WM representations are shaped by
              long-term experience. Influences from training and long-term
              memory may reconcile competing accounts of lPFC function during

              Although much is known about how attentional control and working
              memory capacity relate to each other and to constructs like fluid
              intelligence, little is known about how trial-by-trial
              fluctuations in attentional engagement impact trial-by-trial
              working memory performance. Here, we employ a novel whole-report
              memory task that allowed us to distinguish between varying levels
              of attentional engagement in humans performing a working memory
              task. By characterizing low-performance trials, we can
              distinguish between models in which working memory performance
              failures are caused by either (1) complete lapses of attention or
              (2) variations in attentional control. We found that performance
              failures increase with set-size and strongly predict working
              memory capacity. Performance variability was best modeled by an
              attentional control model of attention, not a lapse model. We
              examined neural signatures of performance failures by measuring
              EEG activity while participants performed the whole-report task.
              The number of items correctly recalled in the memory task was
              predicted by frontal theta power, with decreased frontal theta
              power associated with poor performance on the task. In addition,
              we found that poor performance was not explained by failures of
              sensory encoding; the P1/N1 response and ocular artifact rates
              were equivalent for high- and low-performance trials. In all, we
              propose that attentional lapses alone cannot explain individual
              differences in working memory performance. Instead, we find that
              graded fluctuations in attentional control better explain the

              are sharply limited, but debate persists regarding the simple
              question of whether there is a limit to the total number of items
              that can be stored concurrently. Zhang and Luck (2008) advanced
              this debate with an analytic procedure that provided strong
              evidence for random guessing responses, but their findings can
              also be described by models that deny guessing while asserting a
              high prevalence of low precision memories. Here, we used a whole
              report memory procedure in which subjects reported all items in
              each trial and indicated whether they were guessing with each
              response. Critically, this procedure allowed us to measure memory
              performance for all items in each trial. When subjects were asked
              to remember 6 items, the response error distributions for about 3
              out of the 6 items were best fit by a parameter-free guessing
              model (i.e. a uniform distribution). In addition, subjects'
              self-reports of guessing precisely tracked the guessing rate
              estimated with a mixture model. Control experiments determined
              that guessing behavior was not due to output interference, and
              that there was still a high prevalence of guessing when subjects
              were instructed not to guess. Our novel approach yielded evidence
              that guesses, not low-precision representations, best explain
              limitations in working memory. These guesses also corroborate a
              capacity-limited working memory system - we found evidence that
              subjects are able to report non-zero information for only 3-4
              items. Thus, WM capacity is constrained by an item limit that
              precludes the storage of more than 3-4 individuated feature
              values.",

              ability to internally generate images de novo (i.e., mental
              imagery). Research on mental imagery has to this point focused
              mostly on whether mental images activate early sensory areas,
              with mixed results [5-7]. Recent studies suggest that
              multivariate pattern analysis of neural activity patterns in
              visual regions can reveal content-specific representations during
              cognitive processes, even though overall activation levels are

              Why does imagery vary so much from one individual to the next?
              Here, we used a behavioral paradigm that measures the functional
              impact of a mental image on subsequent conscious perception and
              related these measures to the anatomy of the early visual cortex

              between V1 and imagery precision (spatial location and
              orientation). Hence, individuals with a smaller V1 tended to have
              stronger, but less precise imagery. In addition, subjective
              vividness of imagery was positively related to prefrontal cortex

              imaging with blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast at

              confirmed by simultaneous electromyographic monitoring of a hand
              muscle. Suprathreshold rTMS activated a network of primary and
              secondary cortical motor regions including M1/S1, supplementary
              motor area, dorsal premotor cortex, cingulate motor area, the

              led to a similar activation pattern as obtained for

              number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device
              than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that
              there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three
              to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide
              variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller
              capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in
              analyses of information processing only if the boundary
              conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four
              basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity
              limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information
              overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when
              other steps are taken specifically to block the recording of
              stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance
              discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various
              indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions,
              rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus
              items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms
              that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the
              capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall.
              A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is
              implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The

              compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held
              chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall

              items. Here, we examine whether changes in spatial attention
              could better account for VWM performance, independent of load.
              Across 2 experiments, performance was better predicted by the
              prioritization of memory items (i.e., attention) than by the
              number of items to be remembered (i.e., memory load). This
              relationship followed a power law, and held regardless of whether
              performance was assessed based on overall precision or any of 3
              measures in a mixture model. Moreover, at large set sizes, even
              minimally attended items could receive a small proportion of

              sensory cortex change as a function of load, as one would expect
              from a region storing multiple representations. Here, we use
              multivoxel pattern analysis to examine the neural representations
              of VSTM in humans across multiple memory loads. In an important
              extension of previous findings, our results demonstrate that the

              transient response to visual stimuli, but not from regions that
              exhibit elevated, sustained load-sensitive delay-period activity.
              Moreover, the neural information present in these transiently
              activated areas decreases significantly with increasing load,
              indicating load sensitivity of the patterns of activity that

              In line with this view, previous work has demonstrated that
              oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) plays a role in
              WM maintenance, but the exact contributions of this activity have

              whether the topographic distribution of alpha-band activity

              Monkeys were trained to fixate a central spot during a brief
              presentation (0.5 s) of a peripheral cue and throughout a
              subsequent delay period (1-6 s), and then, upon the extinction of
              the fixation target, to make a saccadic eye movement to where the
              cue had been presented. Cues were usually presented in one of
              eight different locations separated by 45 degrees. This task thus
              requires monkeys to direct their gaze to the location of a
              remembered visual cue, controls the retinal coordinates of the
              visual cues, controls the monkey's oculomotor behavior during the
              delay period, and also allows precise measurement of the timing
              and direction of the relevant behavioral responses. 2. Recordings
              were obtained from 288 neurons in the prefrontal cortex within
              and surrounding the principal sulcus (PS) while monkeys performed
              this task. An additional 31 neurons in the frontal eye fields
              (FEF) region within and near the anterior bank of the arcuate
              sulcus were also studied. 3. Of the 288 PS neurons, 170 exhibited
              task-related activity during at least one phase of this task and,
              of these, 87 showed significant excitation or inhibition of
              activity during the delay period relative to activity during the
              intertrial interval. 4. Delay period activity was classified as
              directional for 79\% of these 87 neurons in that significant
              responses only occurred following cues located over a certain
              range of visual field directions and were weak or absent for
              other cue directions. The remaining 21\% were omnidirectional,
              i.e., showed comparable delay period activity for all visual
              field locations tested. Directional preferences, or lack thereof,
              were maintained across different delay intervals (1-6 s). 5. For
              50 of the 87 PS neurons, activity during the delay period was
              significantly elevated above the neuron's spontaneous rate for at
              least one cue location; for the remaining 37 neurons only
              inhibitory delay period activity was seen. Nearly all (92\%)
              neurons with excitatory delay period activity were directional
              and few (8\%) were omnidirectional. Most (62\%) neurons with
              purely inhibitory delay period activity were directional, but a
              substantial minority (38\%) was omnidirectional. 6. Fifteen of
              the neurons with excitatory directional delay period activity
              also had significant inhibitory delay period activity for other
              cue directions. These inhibitory responses were usually strongest

              This implies that neurons both represent probability

              of oscillatory activity (e.g., event-related synchronization) in
              response to cognitively relevant stimuli. Here, we provide a link

              is that peaks and troughs of oscillatory activity fluctuate
              asymmetrically; e.g., peaks are more strongly modulated than
              troughs in response to stimuli. As a consequence, oscillatory
              brain activity will not ``average out'' when multiple trials are

  abstract = "Previous studies from our laboratory identified a parietal eye
              field in the primate lateral intraparietal sulcus, the lateral
              intraparietal area (area LIP). Here we further explore the role
              of area LIP in processing saccadic eye movements by observing the
              effects of reversible inactivation of this area. One to 2 microl
              of muscimol (8 mg/ml) were injected at locations where
              saccade-related activities were recorded for each lesion
              experiment. After the muscimol injection we observed in two
              macaque monkeys consistent effects on both the metrics and
              dynamics of saccadic eye movements at many injection sites. These
              effects usually took place within 10-30 min and disappeared after
              5-6 h in most cases and certainly when tested the next day. After
              muscimol injection memory saccades directed toward the
              contralesional and upper space became hypometric, and in one
              monkey those to the ipsilesional space were slightly but
              significantly hypermetric. In some cases, the scatter of the end
              points of memory saccades was also increased. On the other hand,
              the metrics of visual saccades remained relatively intact.
              Latency for both visual and memory saccades toward the
              contralesional space was increased and in many cases displayed a
              higher variance after muscimol lesion. At many injection sites we
              also observed an increase of latency for visual and memory
              saccades toward the upper space. The peak velocities for memory
              saccades toward the contralesional space were decreased after
              muscimol injection. The peak velocities of visual saccades were
              not significantly different from those of the controls. The
              duration of saccadic eye movements either to the ipsilesional or
              contralesional space remained relatively the same for both visual
              and memory saccades. Overall these results demonstrated that we
              were able to selectively inactivate area LIP and observe effects
              on saccadic eye movements. Together with our previous recording
              studies these results futher support the view that area LIP plays
              a direct role in processing incoming sensory information to
              program saccadic eye movements. The results are consistent with
              our unit recording data and microstimulation studies, which
              suggest that area LIP represents contralateral space and also has
              a bias for the upper visual field.",

               that required the animal to remember the spatial location of
               peripheral visual cues, while maintaining fixation on a central
               visual target during the presentation of each cue and during a
               subsequent 1.5-8 sec delay period. Four rhesus monkeys received
               unilateral or serial prefrontal lesions in and around the
               principal sulcus after they reached criterion performance on the
               ODR tasks. Unilateral lesions disrupted the performance of
               memory-guided eye movements to spatial cues in the visual field
               contralateral to the hemisphere in which the lesion was placed.
               Memory-guided eye movements to ipsilateral cues were mildly
               affected by unilateral lesions, and these lesions had little or
               no effect on performance in visually guided control tasks. With
               addition of a second lesion in the opposite hemisphere, the
               deficit was extended to include the opposite hemifield. The
               impairment was characterized by eye movements of inappropriate
               direction, and, excepting the one lesion that extended into the
               frontal eye field region of the arcuate sulcus, saccadic
               reaction times and velocities were the same before and after the
               lesions. The effect of the lesions was delay dependent:
               performance was rarely altered at the shortest (1.5 sec) delay

               caused by failure to maintain a transient memory ``trace'' in
               working memory, and indicate for the first time that working
               memory mechanisms are lateralized: memories for visuo-spatial
               coordinates in each hemifield are processed primarily in the
               contralateral prefrontal cortex. These findings provide evidence

               that of the cued memory item, compared to errors for stimuli
               probed diagonally to TMS. This implied topographic storage of
               orientation information, and a memory-enhancing effect at the
               targeted location. Furthermore, early pulses impaired
               performance at all four locations, compared to late pulses.
               Next, response errors were fit empirically using a mixture model
               to characterize memory precision and guess rates. Memory was
               more precise for items proximal to the pulse location,
               irrespective of pulse timing. Guesses were more probable with
               early TMS pulses, regardless of stimulus location. Thus, while
               TMS administered at the offset of the stimulus array might
               disrupt early-phase consolidation in a non-topographic manner,
               TMS also boosts the precise representation of an item at its
               targeted retinotopic location, possibly by increasing
               attentional resources or by injecting a beneficial amount of
               noise.",

               is available for processing. Given its importance in supporting
               a wide-array of high level cognitive abilities, uncovering the
               neural mechanisms that underlie WM has been a primary goal of
               neuroscience research over the past century. Here, we critically
               review what we consider the two major ``arcs'' of inquiry, with
               a specific focus on findings that were theoretically
               transformative. For the first arc, we briefly review classic
               studies that led to the canonical WM theory that cast the
               prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a central player utilizing persistent
               activity of neurons as a mechanism for memory storage. We then
               consider recent challenges to the theory regarding the role of
               persistent neural activity. The second arc, which evolved over
               the last decade, stemmed from sophisticated computational
               neuroimaging approaches enabling researchers to decode the
               contents of WM from the patterns of neural activity in many
               parts of the brain including early visual cortex. We summarize
               key findings from these studies, their implications for WM
               theory, and finally the challenges these findings pose. Our goal
               in doing so is to identify barriers to developing a
               comprehensive theory of WM that will require a unification of
               these two ``arcs'' of research.",

              memory research. CDA amplitude is sensitive to working memory
              load, reaches an asymptote at known behavioral limits, and
              predicts individual differences in capacity. An open question,
              however, is whether neural measures of load also track
              trial-by-trial fluctuations in performance. Here, we used a
              whole-report working memory task to test the relationship between
              CDA amplitude and working memory performance. If working memory
              failures are due to decision-based errors and retrieval failures,
              CDA amplitude would not differentiate good and poor performance
              trials when load is held constant. If failures arise during
              storage, then CDA amplitude should track both working memory load
              and trial-by-trial performance. As expected, CDA amplitude
              tracked load (Experiment 1), reaching an asymptote at three
              items. In Experiment 2, we tracked fluctuations in trial-by-trial
              performance. CDA amplitude was larger (more negative) for
              high-performance trials compared with low-performance trials,
              suggesting that fluctuations in performance were related to the
              successful storage of items. During working memory failures,
              participants oriented their attention to the correct side of the
              screen (lateralized P1) and maintained covert attention to the
              correct side during the delay period (lateralized alpha power
              suppression). Despite the preservation of attentional orienting,
              we found impairments consistent with an executive attention
              theory of individual differences in working memory capacity;
              fluctuations in executive control (indexed by pretrial frontal
              theta power) may be to blame for storage failures.",

               population receptive field (pRF). These methods build on
               conventional visual field mapping that measures responses to
               ring and wedge patterns shown at a series of visual field
               locations and estimates the single position in the visual field
               that produces the largest response. The new method computes a
               model of the population receptive field from responses to a wide
               range of stimuli and estimates the visual field map as well as
               other neuronal population properties, such as receptive field
               size and laterality. The visual field maps obtained with the pRF
               method are more accurate than those obtained using conventional
               visual field mapping, and we trace with high precision the
               visual field maps to the center of the foveal representation. We

               localizing ability. Previous modeling studies and empirical data
               suggest that a combination of MEG and EEG signals should yield
               the most accurate localization, due to their complementary

               This allowed direct evaluation of the localization accuracy of

               the localization accuracy of the combined MEG+EEG solution was
               consistently better than that of either modality alone, using
               three different source estimation approaches. Further analysis

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the stability of visual phosphene
               thresholds and to assess whether they correlate with motor
               thresholds. BACKGROUND: Currently, motor threshold is used as an
               index of cortical sensitivity so that in transcranial magnetic
               stimulation (TMS) experiments, intensity can be set at a given
               percentage of this value. It is not known whether this is a
               reasonable index of cortical sensitivity in non-motor and hence
               whether it should be used in experiments where other cortical
               areas are targeted. Previous studies have indicated that
               phosphene threshold might be a suitable alternative in TMS
               studies of the visual system. METHOD: Using single pulse TMS
               visual phosphene and motor thresholds were measured in 15
               subjects. Both thresholds were retested in seven of these
               subjects a week later. RESULT: Visual phosphene thresholds,
               though stable within subjects across the two sessions, showed
               greater variability than motor thresholds. There was no
               correlation between the two measures. CONCLUSION: TMS motor
               thresholds cannot be assumed to be a guide to visual cortex
               excitability and by extension are probably an inappropriate
               guide to the cortical excitability of other non-motor areas of
               the brain. Phosphene thresholds are proposed as a potential
               standard for inter-individual comparison in visual TMS
               experiments.",

              that also demonstrate time-locked correlations, with time delays
              that match the phase delays of the coherent oscillations. Here,
              by analyzing functional connectivity in both the time and

              these constraints and are well suited for modulating

              examine intracranial EEG in the human temporal lobe and find
              robust alpha oscillations that are coherent between brain regions

              reorienting, and their temporal dynamics are unknown. We used
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the occipital cortex
              to interfere with attentional reorienting and study its role and
              temporal dynamics in this process. Human observers performed an

              region of interest (ROI). The ROI E-field can be computationally
              maximized and set to match a specific reference using
              individualized head models to find the optimal coil placement and

              practical features for prospective planning of TMS interventions
              and retrospective evaluation of the experimental targeting
              accuracy. Approach The TMS targeting and analysis pipeline (TAP)
              software uses an MRI/fMRI-derived brain target to optimize coil
              placement considering experimental parameters such as the
              subject's hair thickness and coil placement restrictions. The
              coil placement optimization is implemented in SimNIBS 3.2, for
              which an additional graphical user interface (TargetingNavigator)
              is provided to visualize/adjust procedural parameters. The coil
              optimization process also computes the E-field at the target,
              allowing the selection of the TMS device intensity setting to
              achieve specific E-field strengths. The optimized coil placement
              information is prepared for neuronavigation software, which
              supports targeting during the TMS procedure. The neuronavigation
              system can record the coil placement during the experiment, and
              these data can be processed in TAP to quantify the accuracy of
              the experimental TMS coil placement and induced E-field. Main
              results TAP was demonstrated in a study consisting of three
              repetitive TMS sessions in five subjects. TMS was delivered by an
              experienced operator under neuronavigation with the
              computationally optimized coil placement. Analysis of the
              experimental accuracy from the recorded neuronavigation data
              indicated coil location and orientation deviations up to about 2
              mm and 2°, respectively, resulting in an 8\% median decrease in
              the target E-field magnitude compared to the optimal placement.

              generalizes to other sensory modalities is a topic of ongoing
              scientific debate. Here, we designed an auditory paradigm
              eliminating any visual input in which participants were required
              to attend to upcoming sounds from one of 24 loudspeakers arranged
              in a horizontal circular array around the head. Maintaining the
              location of an auditory cue was associated with a topographically
              modulated distribution of posterior alpha power resembling the
              findings known from visual attention. Alpha power modulations in
              all electrodes allowed us to predict the sound location in the
              horizontal plane using a forward encoding model. Importantly,
              this prediction was still possible, albeit weaker, when derived
              from the horizontal electrooculogram capturing saccadic behavior.
              We conclude that attending to an auditory target engages
              oculomotor and visual cortical areas in a topographic manner akin
              to the retinotopic organization associated with visual attention

              discharge rates in cortical neurons. When this altered neuronal
              discharge rate, called delay activity, shows stimulus
              specificity, it is a good candidate for a neuronal mechanism of
              working memory. If the delay activity is indeed the carrier of
              memory, then experimental manipulation during the delay period
              that disrupts delay activity should also disrupt behavioral
              performance. We tested this hypothesis in two macaque monkeys
              with a delayed matching-to-sample task (delay time: 8 or 10 s) in
              which only two visual images were used. In each trial, one of the
              images was randomly chosen as the sample. In control trials
              (without disruptive stimulation), the monkeys performed at the
              level of 74.3\% correct recognition. Three electrical stimulation
              levels (mild: a 0.25-s train of electrical pulses; medium: 1-s
              train; strong: 4 s), delivered to the hippocampal formation or to
              the orbito-frontal and inferotemporal cortices during delay
              period, decreased the performance to 71.4, 66.8, and 58.0\%
              respectively (all are significantly less than control
              performance, P < 0.05 for mild stimulation and P < 0.0001 for
              other stimulation levels). Three hundred and thirty-four cells
              were recorded from inferotemporal (211 cells) and prefrontal (123
              cells) cortices. Significant (P < 0.05) stimulus-specific delay

              difference to 20\% (not a statistically significant reduction) in
              trials with mild stimulation, to 14\% (P < 0.05) with medium
              stimulation, and just to 4\% (P < 0.0005) with strong

              neuronal information transfer and retention. Phases along the

              high-excitability states correspond to high-frequency neuronal
              activity and heightened capacity for plasticity induction, as
              demonstrated in animal studies. Human studies corroborate this
              model and suggest a core role of prefrontal theta activity in
              working memory (WM). OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed at modulating
              prefrontal neuronal excitability and WM performance in healthy
              humans, using real-time EEG analysis for triggering repetitive
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) theta-phase synchronized
              to the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. METHODS: 16 subjects
              underwent 3 different rTMS interventions on separate days, with
              pulses triggered according to the individual's real-time EEG
              activity: 400 rTMS gamma-frequency (100 Hz) triplet bursts
              applied during either the negative peak of the prefrontal theta

              single-pulse TMS, and behavioral effects by using a WM task.
              RESULTS: Negative-peak rTMS increased single-pulse TMS-induced
              prefrontal theta power and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling,
              and decreased WM response time. In contrast, positive-peak rTMS
              decreased prefrontal theta power, while no changes were observed

  abstract = "Cortical areas involved in sensory analysis are also believed to
              be involved in short-term storage of that sensory information.
              Here we investigated whether transcranial magnetic stimulation
              (TMS) can reveal the content of visual short-term memory (VSTM)
              by bringing this information to visual awareness. Subjects were
              presented with two random-dot displays (moving either to the left
              or to the right) and they were required to maintain one of these
              in VSTM. In Experiment 1, TMS was applied over the
              motion-selective area V5/MT+ above phosphene threshold during the
              maintenance phase. The reported phosphene contained motion
              features of the memory item, when the phosphene spatially
              overlapped with memory item. Specifically, phosphene motion was
              enhanced when the memory item moved in the same direction as the
              subjects' V5/MT+ baseline phosphene, whereas it was reduced when
              the motion direction of the memory item was incongruent with that
              of the baseline V5/MT+ phosphene. There was no effect on
              phosphene reports when there was no spatial overlap between the
              phosphene and the memory item. In Experiment 2, VSTM maintenance
              did not influence the appearance of phosphenes induced from the
              lateral occipital region. These interactions between VSTM
              maintenance and phosphene appearance demonstrate that activity in
              V5/MT+ reflects the motion qualities of items maintained in VSTM.
              Furthermore, these results also demonstrate that information in
              VSTM can modulate the pattern of visual activation reaching
              awareness, providing evidence for the view that overlapping
              neuronal populations are involved in conscious visual perception

              support for the view that the stimulation of several different
              visual areas in the occipital lobe may produce phosphenes, it is
              not clear what the contribution of each area is. Here, we studied

              Reports of the subjective visual features of phosphenes were

              maintains successive images, we analyzed with
              electroencephalography the brain activity of human subjects while
              they watched ∼5000 visual stimuli presented in fast sequences.
              First, we confirm that each stimulus can be decoded from brain
              activity for ∼1s, and we demonstrate that the brain

              activity in animals including humans. This rhythmic brain
              activity interacts in complex ways with rhythms in the internal

              Some senses, such as touch and vision, sample the environment

              and action exhibit distinct oscillatory phenomena, measured in
              humans by electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). So far,
              the correlative or causal nature of the link between brain
              oscillations and functions has remained elusive. A compelling
              demonstration of causality would primarily generate oscillatory
              signatures that are known to correlate with particular cognitive
              functions and then assess the behavioral consequences. Here, we
              provide the first direct evidence for causal entrainment of brain
              oscillations by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using
              concurrent EEG. RESULTS: We used rhythmic TMS bursts to directly
              interact with an MEG-identified parietal $\alpha$-oscillator,
              activated by attention and linked to perception. With TMS bursts
              tuned to its preferred $\alpha$-frequency ($\alpha$-TMS), we
              confirmed the three main predictions of entrainment of a natural
              oscillator: (1) that $\alpha$-oscillations are induced during
              $\alpha$-TMS (reproducing an oscillatory signature of the
              stimulated parietal cortex), (2) that there is progressive
              enhancement of this $\alpha$-activity (synchronizing the
              targeted, $\alpha$-generator to the $\alpha$-TMS train), and (3)
              that this depends on the pre-TMS phase of the background
              $\alpha$-rhythm (entrainment of natural, ongoing
              $\alpha$-oscillations). Control conditions testing different TMS
              burst profiles and TMS-EEG in a phantom head confirmed
              specificity of $\alpha$-boosting to the case of synchronization
              between TMS train and neural oscillator. CONCLUSIONS: The
              periodic electromagnetic force that is generated during rhythmic
              TMS can cause local entrainment of natural brain oscillations,
              emulating oscillatory signatures activated by cognitive tasks.
              This reveals a new mechanism of online TMS action on brain
              activity and can account for frequency-specific behavioral TMS

                  values. However, the distributional codes explored so far
                  rely on a complex imputation step which crucially relies on
                  spatial non-locality: in order to compute reward prediction
                  errors, units must know not only their own state but also the
                  states of the other units. It is far from clear how these
                  steps could be implemented in realistic neural circuits.
                  Here, we introduce the Laplace code: a local temporal
                  difference code for distributional reinforcement learning
                  that is representationally powerful and computationally
                  straightforward. The code decomposes value distributions and

                  Besides lending itself to a local learning rule, the

                  immediate reward distribution, indicating all possible

  abstract = "Measurement of the T2 distribution in tissues provides
              biologically relevant information about normal and abnormal
              microstructure and organization. Typically, the T2 distribution
              is obtained by fitting the magnitude MR images acquired by a
              multi-echo MRI pulse sequence using an inverse Laplace transform
              (ILT) algorithm. It is well known that the ideal magnitude MR
              signal follows a Rician distribution. Unfortunately, studies
              attempting to establish the validity and efficacy of the ILT
              algorithm assume that these input signals are Gaussian
              distributed. Violation of the normality (or Gaussian) assumption
              introduces unexpected artifacts, including spurious cerebrospinal
              fluid (CSF)-like long T2 components; bias of the true geometric
              mean T2 values and in the relative fractions of various
              components; and blurring of nearby T2 peaks in the T2
              distribution. Here we apply and extend our previously proposed
              magnitude signal transformation framework to map noisy
              Rician-distributed magnitude multi-echo MRI signals into
              Gaussian-distributed signals with high accuracy and precision. We
              then perform an ILT on the transformed data to obtain an accurate
              T2 distribution. Additionally, we demonstrate, by simulations and
              experiments, that this approach corrects the aforementioned
              artifacts in magnitude multi-echo MR images over a large range of
              signal-to-noise ratios.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The inverse Laplace transform (ILT) is the most
              widely used method for T2 relaxometry data analysis. This study
              examines the qualitative agreement of ILT and a proposed
              multiexponential (Mexp method) regarding the number of T2
              components. We performed a feasibility study for the voxelwise
              characterisation of heterogeneous tissue with T2 relaxometry.
              METHODS: Eleven samples of aqueous, fatty and mixed composition
              were analysed using ILT and Mexp. The phantom was imaged using a
              1.5-T system with a single slice T2 relaxometry 25-echo
              Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence in order to obtain the T2
              decay curve with 25 equidistant echo times. The adjusted R2
              goodness of fit criterion was used to determine the number of T2
              components using the Mexp method on a voxel-based analysis.
              Comparison of mean and standard deviation of T2 values for both
              methods was performed by fitting a Gaussian function to the ILT
              resulting vector. RESULTS: Phantom results showed pure
              monoexponential decay for acetone and water and pure
              biexponential behaviour for corn oil, egg yolk, and 35\% fat milk
              cream, while mixtures of egg whites and yolks as well as milk
              creams with 12-20\% fatty composition exhibit mixed
              monoexponential and biexponential behaviour at different
              fractions. The number of T2 components by the Mexp method was
              compared to the ILT-derived spectrum as ground truth.
              CONCLUSIONS: Mexp analysis with the adjusted R2 criterion can be
              used for the detection of the T2 distribution of aqueous, fatty
              and mixed samples with the added advantage of voxelwise mapping.",

              synaptic efficacies endowed with short-term synaptic plasticity.
              To test this idea computationally, we investigated recurrent
              neural network models trained to perform several WM-dependent

              support the short-term maintenance of information, provided that
              the memory delay period is sufficiently short. However, in tasks
              that require actively manipulating information, persistent

              An alternative view is that information can be remembered in a
              flexible format that best suits current behavioral goals. For
              example, remembered visual information might be stored in sensory

              re-coded into a more abstract action-oriented format and stored
              in motor areas. Here, we tested this hypothesis using a

              response was either known or unknown during the memory delay

              are still unclear. In the first part of this study we show that
              the masking effect of TMS differs to masking by light in terms of
              the psychometric function. Here we investigate the emergence of
              phosphenes in relation to perimetric measurements. The coil
              positions were measured with a stereotactic positioning device,
              and stimulation sites were characterized in four subjects on the
              basis of individual retinotopic maps measured by with functional
              magnetic resonance imaging. Phosphene thresholds were found to
              lie a factor of 0.59 below the stimulation intensities required
              to induce visual masking. They covered the segments in the visual
              field where visual suppression occurred with higher stimulation
              intensity. Both phosphenes and transient scotomas were found in
              the lower visual field in the quadrant contralateral to the
              stimulated hemisphere. They could be evoked from a large area
              over the occipital pole. Phosphene contours and texture remained
              quite stable with different coil positions over one hemisphere
              and did not change with the retinotopy of the different visual
              areas on which the coil was focused. They cannot be related
              exclusively to a certain functionally defined visual area. It is
              most likely that both the optic radiation close to its
              termination in the dorsal parts of V1 and back-projecting fibers
              from V2 and V3 back to V1 generate phosphenes and scotomas.",

                  al, which can be summarized as follows. Humans know the
                  uncertainty of their working memory and use it to make
                  decisions; the content and the uncertainty of working memory
                  can be decoded from BOLD signals; decoding errors predict
                  memory errors at the single-trial level; decoded uncertainty
                  correlates with behavioral reports of working memory
                  uncertainty. Later I learned about the findings of Manassi
                  and Whitney about the stability illusion of perceptions
                  making the world look smoothly changing and effectively
                  shifting the perception towards the past. It is not too
                  surprising that the states of feature detector neurons obey a
                  statistical distribution. It is however not obvious that the
                  reliability of the memory should correlate with the width of
                  this distribution and that even the subjective estimate for
                  the reliability should reflect this width. If one accepts the
                  notion of a quantum brain, the distribution of features could
                  reflect the non-determinism of the outcome in the reduction
                  of entanglement quantum measurements producing sensations.
                  Zero energy ontology (ZEO) leads to the notion of 4-D brain
                  and suggests that the feature ensemble is not spatial, as it
                  should be in standard quantum theory, but a temporal ensemble
                  formed by the memory mental images of the feature. Quite
                  generally, in ZEO sequences of ``small'' state function
                  reductions (SSFRs) as counterparts of so called weak
                  measurements would form temporal ensembles of memory mental
                  images so that the connection with short term memory would be
                  direct. This picture explains the findings of both Li et al

              attention to sudden visual events are poorly understood because
              they are tightly intertwined with purely sensory processes. Here
              we isolated visually guided orienting activity from sensory
              activity using event-related potentials (ERPs). By recording ERPs
              to a lateral stimulus and comparing waveforms obtained under
              conditions of attention and inattention, we identified an early
              positive deflection over the ipsilateral visual cortex that was
              associated with the covert orienting of visual attention to the
              stimulus. Across five experiments with male and female adults
              participants, this ipsilateral visual orienting activity (VOA)
              could be distinguished from purely sensory-evoked activity and
              from other top-down spatial attention effects. The VOA was linked
              with behavioral measures of orienting, being significantly larger
              when the stimulus was detected rapidly than when it was detected
              more slowly, and its presence was independent of saccadic eye
              movements towards the targets. The VOA appears to be a specific
              neural index of the visually guided orienting of attention to a
              stimulus that appears abruptly in an otherwise uncluttered visual
              field.Significance Statement:The study of visual attention
              orienting has been an important impetus for the field of
              cognitive neuroscience. Seminal reaction-time studies
              demonstrated that a suddenly appearing visual stimulus attracts
              attention involuntarily, but the neural processes associated with
              visually guided attention orienting have been difficult to
              isolate because they are intertwined with sensory processes that
              trigger the orienting. Here, we disentangled orienting activity
              from sensory activity using scalp recordings of event-related
              electrical activity in the human brain. A specific neural index
              of visually guided attention orienting was identified.
              Surprisingly, whereas peripheral sensory stimulation is processed
              initially and predominantly by the contralateral visual cortex,
              this electrophysiological index of visual orienting was recorded
              over the cerebral hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the
              attention-capturing stimulus.",

              were 60 years or older scheduled for elective radical
              prostatectomy under general anaesthesia. We obtained

              total number of 26 patients completed neuropsychological
              assessments and EEG pre- and postoperatively. Behavioural
              performance declined in the neuropsychological assessment after

              Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.015 d = -0.902), while WM performance

              signatures tracked behavioural performance: Better performance in
              the NP assessment was correlated with an increase of

              cortical activity ( cluster permutation tests: total recall r =
              0.66, p = 0.029, learning slope r = 0.66, p = 0.015), while WM
              accuracy was tracked by distinct temporally-structured
              oscillatory theta/alpha (7 -- 9 Hz), low beta (14 -- 18 Hz) and
              high beta/gamma (34 -- 38 Hz) activity ( cluster permutation

              the time course and neural substrates of each type of orienting,
              these two attention systems are often treated as fundamentally
              distinct. However, recent studies suggest that rhythmic neural
              activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and slow waves in the

              assess whether these neural changes index common processes of
              spatial attention, we conducted two within-subject experiments
              varying the two main dimensions over which endogenous and
              exogenous attention tasks typically differ: cue informativity
              (spatially predictive vs. non-predictive) and cue format
              (centrally vs. peripherally presented). This task design allowed
              us to tease apart neural changes related to top-down goals and
              those driven by the reflexive orienting of spatial attention, and
              examine their interactions in a novel hybrid cross-modal
              attention task. Our data demonstrate that both central and
              peripheral cues elicit lateralized ERPs over parietal-occipital
              cortex, though at different points in time, consistent with these
              ERPs reflecting the orienting of spatial attention. Lateralized
              alpha activity was also present across all tasks, emerging
              rapidly for peripheral cues and sustaining longer for spatially
              informative cues. Overall, these data indicate that distinct
              slow-wave ERPs index the spatial orienting of endogenous and
              exogenous attention, while lateralized alpha activity represents
              a common signature of visual-cortical biasing in anticipation of

  title    = "Fast computational optimization of {TMS} coil placement for
              individualized electric field targeting",
  author   = "Gomez, Luis J and Dannhauer, Moritz and Peterchev, Angel V",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: During transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) a coil
              placed on the scalp is used to non-invasively modulate activity
              of targeted brain networks via a magnetically induced electric
              field (E-field). Ideally, the E-field induced during TMS is
              concentrated on a targeted cortical region of interest (ROI).
              Determination of the coil position and orientation that best
              achieve this objective presently requires a large computational
              effort. OBJECTIVE: To improve the accuracy of TMS we have
              developed a fast computational auxiliary dipole method (ADM) for
              determining the optimum coil position and orientation. The
              optimum coil placement maximizes the E-field along a
              predetermined direction or, alternatively, the overall E-field
              magnitude in the targeted ROI. Furthermore, ADM can assess
              E-field uncertainty resulting from precision limitations of TMS
              coil placement protocols. METHOD: ADM leverages the
              electromagnetic reciprocity principle to compute rapidly the TMS
              induced E-field in the ROI by using the E-field generated by a
              virtual constant current source residing in the ROI. The
              framework starts by solving for the conduction currents resulting
              from this ROI current source. Then, it rapidly determines the
              average E-field induced in the ROI for each coil position by
              using the conduction currents and a fast-multipole method. To
              further speed-up the computations, the coil is approximated using
              auxiliary dipoles enabling it to represent all coil orientations
              for a given coil position with less than 600 dipoles. RESULTS:
              Using ADM, the E-fields generated in an MRI-derived head model
              when the coil is placed at 5900 different scalp positions and 360
              coil orientations per position (over 2.1 million unique
              configurations) can be determined in under 15 min on a standard
              laptop computer. This enables rapid extraction of the optimum
              coil position and orientation as well as the E-field variation
              resulting from coil positioning uncertainty. ADM is implemented
              in SimNIBS 3.2. CONCLUSION: ADM enables the rapid determination
              of coil placement that maximizes E-field delivery to a specific
              brain target. This method can find the optimum coil placement in
              under 15 min enabling its routine use for TMS. Furthermore, it
              enables the fast quantification of uncertainty in the induced
              E-field due to limited precision of TMS coil placement protocols,
              enabling minimization and statistical analysis of the E-field
              dose variability.",

              architecture connection topology. Astrocytes generating calcium
              signals are connected by local gap junction diffusive couplings
              and interact with neurons via chemicals diffused in the
              extracellular space. Calcium elevations occur in response to the
              increased concentration of the neurotransmitter released by
              spiking neurons when a group of them fire coherently. In turn,
              gliotransmitters are released by activated astrocytes modulating
              the strength of the synaptic connections in the corresponding
              neuronal group. Input information is encoded as two-dimensional
              patterns of short applied current pulses stimulating neurons. The
              output is taken from frequencies of transient discharges of
              corresponding neurons. We show how a set of information patterns

              Information retrieval is organized by the application of a cue

              analyzed the dynamical mechanism of WM formation, we discovered

              can successfully store traces of neuronal activations
              corresponding to information patterns. In the retrieval stage,
              the astrocytic network selectively modulates synaptic connections
              in the SNN leading to successful recall. Information and

  abstract = "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a tool for inducing
              transient disruptions of neural activity noninvasively in
              conscious human volunteers. In recent years, the investigative
              domain of TMS has expanded and now encompasses causal
              structure-function relationships across the whole gamut of
              cognitive functions and associated cortical brain regions.
              Consequently, the importance of how to determine the target
              stimulation site has increased and a number of alternative
              methods have emerged. Comparison across studies is precluded
              because different studies necessarily use different tasks, sites,
              TMS conditions, and have different goals. Here, therefore, we
              systematically compare four commonly used TMS coil positioning
              approaches by using them to induce behavioral change in a single
              cognitive study. Specifically, we investigated the behavioral
              impact of right parietal TMS during a number comparison task,
              while basing TMS localization either on (i) individual
              fMRI-guided TMS neuronavigation, (ii) individual MRI-guided TMS
              neuronavigation, (iii) group functional Talairach coordinates, or
              (iv) 10-20 EEG position P4. We quantified the exact behavioral
              effects induced by TMS using each approach, calculated the
              standardized experimental effect sizes, and conducted a
              statistical power analysis in order to calculate the optimal
              sample size required to reveal statistical significance. Our
              findings revealed a systematic difference between the four
              approaches, with the individual fMRI-guided TMS neuronavigation
              yielding the strongest and the P4 stimulation approach yielding
              the smallest behavioral effect size. Accordingly, power analyses
              revealed that although in the fMRI-guided neuronavigation
              approach five participants were sufficient to reveal a
              significant behavioral effect, the number of necessary
              participants increased to n = 9 when employing MRI-guided
              neuronavigation, to n = 13 in case of TMS based on group
              Talairach coordinates, and to n = 47 when applying TMS over P4.
              We discuss these graded effect size differences in light of the

              top-down influences on retinotopic visual cortex, but to date
              neuroimaging methods have only been able to provide indirect
              evidence for such functional interactions between remote but
              interconnected brain regions. Here we combined transcranial
              magnetic stimulation (TMS) with concurrent functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI), plus psychophysics, to show that
              stimulation of the right human frontal eye-field (FEF) produced a
              characteristic topographic pattern of activity changes in
              retinotopic visual areas V1-V4, with functional consequences for
              visual perception. RESULTS: FEF TMS led to activity increases for
              retinotopic representations of the peripheral visual field, but
              to activity decreases for the central field, in areas V1-V4.
              These frontal influences on visual cortex occurred in a top-down
              manner, independently of visual input. TMS of a control site
              (vertex) did not elicit such visual modulations, and saccades,
              blinks, or pupil dilation could not account for our results.
              Finally, the effects of FEF TMS on activity in retinotopic visual
              cortex led to a behavioral prediction that we confirmed
              psychophysically by showing that TMS of the frontal site (again
              compared with vertex) enhanced perceived contrast for peripheral
              relative to central visual stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              provide causal evidence that circuits originating in the human
              FEF can modulate activity in retinotopic visual cortex, in a
              manner that differentiates the central and peripheral visual
              field, with functional consequences for perception. More
              generally, our study illustrates how the new approach of

              processing. To causally investigate FPN-DMN contributions to high
              cognitive demand processing, the current interleaved TMS-fMRI
              study simultaneously manipulated and indexed neural activity
              while tracking cognitive performance during high and low
              cognitive load conditions. METHODS: Twenty participants completed
              an n-back task consisting of four conditions (0-back, 0-backTMS,
              2-back, 2-backTMS) while undergoing interleaved TMS-fMRI. During
              TMS concurrent with n-back blocks, TMS single pulses were
              delivered to the left DLPFC at 100\% motor-threshold every 2.4s.
              RESULTS: TMS delivered during high cognitive load strengthened
              cognitive processing. FPN node activations and DMN node
              deactivations were increased in the high versus low cognitive
              load TMS condition. Contrary to our hypothesis, TMS did not
              increase high load related activation in FPN nodes. However, as
              hypothesized, increased DMN node deactivations emerged as a
              function of TMS during high load (right angular gyrus) and from
              interactions between cognitive load and TMS (right middle
              temporal gyrus). Load and TMS combined to dampen activation
              within the DMN at trend level (p = .058). Deactivation in a
              dorsomedial DMN node was associated with TMS driven improvements
              in high load cognitive processing. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous

  author   = "Contreras, D and Steriade, M",
  abstract = "A slow oscillation (< 1 Hz) has recently been described in
              intracellular recordings from the neocortex and thalamus
              (Steriade et al., 1993c-e). The aim of the present study was to
              determine the phase relations between cortical and thalamic
              neuronal activities during the slow EEG oscillation.
              Intracellular recordings were performed in anesthetized cats from
              neurons in motor and somatosensory cortical areas, the
              rostrolateral sector of the reticular (RE) thalamic nucleus, and
              thalamocortical (TC) cells from ventrolateral (VL) nucleus. The
              EEG was used as time reference for alignment of activities in
              different, simultaneously recorded neurons, including dual
              impalements of cortical cells as well as cortical and TC cells.
              The spontaneous EEG oscillation was characterized by slowly
              recurring (0.3-0.9 Hz) sequences of surface-positive
              (depth-negative) sharp deflections, often followed by oscillatory
              activity within the frequency range of sleep spindles (7-14 Hz)
              or at faster frequencies. Cortical and RE cells were similarly
              hyperpolarized during the depth-positive EEG waves and were
              depolarized during the depth-negative EEG deflections. In many
              instances, the cell depolarization was associated with
              oscillations at the spindle frequency or with tonic firing at
              rates related to the level of depolarization. TC neurons were
              hyperpolarized during the depth-positive EEG waves and displayed
              a series of IPSPs, at the spindle frequencies, during the
              depth-negative EEG waves. Depending on the membrane potential
              (Vm), TC cells could fire spike bursts at the onset of the EEG
              depth-negativity, or their firing could be delayed by subsequent
              IPSPs. The sequence of spontaneous EEG and cellular events
              described above also characterized the responses to cortical and
              thalamic stimulation. Simultaneous intracellular recordings of
              pairs of cortical cells or cortical and TC cells showed that
              spontaneous transitions from less synchronized to more
              synchronized EEG states were marked by a simultaneous
              hyperpolarization, coincident with an overt depth-positive EEG
              wave. We conclude that during low-frequency oscillatory states,
              characteristic of slow-wave sleep, neocortical and thalamic
              neurons display phase relations that are restricted to narrow
              time windows, and that synchronization results from a generalized
              inhibitory phenomenon. Moreover, EEG synchronization is reflected
              as active inhibition in TC neurons. That this pattern is also
              present in states of hypersynchronization, such as seizure
              activity, is shown in the following paper (Steriade and
              Contreras, 1994).",

              high-excitability states. In vitro experiments showed that
              induction of long-term depression (LTD) by low-frequency
              stimulation depends on the postsynaptic excitability state.
              OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We tested the hypothesis that induction of
              LTD-like corticospinal plasticity in humans by 1 Hz repetitive
              TMS (rTMS) is enhanced when rTMS is synchronized with the
              low-excitability state, but decreased or even shifted towards
              long-term (LTP)-like plasticity when synchronized with the
              high-excitability state. METHODS: We applied real-time
              EEG-triggered 1-Hz-rTMS (900 pulses) to the hand area of motor
              cortex in healthy subjects. In a randomized double-blind
              three-condition crossover design, pulses were synchronized to
              either the positive or negative peak of the sensorimotor
              $\mu$-oscillation, or were applied at random phase (control). The
              amplitude of motor evoked potentials was recorded as an index of
              corticospinal excitability before and after 1-Hz-rTMS. RESULTS:
              1-Hz-rTMS at random phase resulted in a trend towards LTD-like
              corticospinal plasticity. RTMS in the positive peak condition
              (i.e., the low-excitability state) induced significant LTD-like
              plasticity. RTMS in the negative peak condition (i.e., the
              high-excitability state) showed a trend towards LTP-like
              plasticity, which was significantly different from the other two
              conditions. CONCLUSION: The level of corticospinal depolarization

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Theta-band neuronal oscillations in the prefrontal
              cortex are associated with several cognitive functions.
              Oscillatory phase is an important correlate of excitability and
              phase synchrony mediates information transfer between neuronal
              populations oscillating at that frequency. The ability to extract
              and exploit the prefrontal theta rhythm in real time in humans
              would facilitate insight into neurophysiological mechanisms of
              cognitive processes involving the prefrontal cortex, and
              development of brain-state-dependent stimulation for therapeutic
              applications. OBJECTIVES: We investigate individual source-space
              beamforming-based estimation of the prefrontal theta oscillation
              as a method to target specific phases of the ongoing theta
              oscillations in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC)
              with real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation
              (TMS). Different spatial filters for extracting the prefrontal
              theta oscillation from EEG signals are compared and additional
              signal quality criteria are assessed to take into account the
              dynamics of this cortical oscillation. METHODS: Twenty two
              healthy participants were recruited for anatomical MRI scans and
              EEG recordings with 18 composing the final analysis. We
              calculated individual spatial filters based on EEG beamforming in
              source space. The extracted EEG signal was then used to simulate
              real-time phase-detection and quantify the accuracy as compared
              to post-hoc phase estimates. Different spatial filters and
              triggering parameters were compared. Finally, we validated the
              feasibility of this approach by actual real-time triggering of
              TMS pulses at different phases of the prefrontal theta
              oscillation. RESULTS: Higher phase-detection accuracy was
              achieved using individualized source-based spatial filters, as
              compared to an average or standard Laplacian filter, and also by
              detecting and avoiding periods of low theta amplitude and periods
              containing a phase reset. Using optimized parameters, prefrontal
              theta-phase synchronized TMS of DMPFC was achieved with an
              accuracy of $\pm$55°. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the
              feasibility of triggering TMS pulses during different phases of
              the ongoing prefrontal theta oscillation in real time. This
              method is relevant for brain state-dependent stimulation in human
              studies of cognition. It will also enable new personalized

              However, determining phase at the time of a stimulus with
              standard signal processing methods is not possible due to the
              stimulus artifact masking the future part of the signal. Here, we
              quantify the degree to which signal-to-noise ratio and
              instantaneous amplitude of the signal affect the variance of
              phase estimation error and the precision with which ``ground

              phosphene thresholds and their relationship to individual
              differences in visual cognition are poorly understood. Here, we
              investigated the neurochemical basis of phosphene perception by
              measuring basal GABA and glutamate levels in primary visual
              cortex using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We further examined
              whether phosphene thresholds would relate to the visuospatial
              phenomenology of grapheme-color synesthesia, a condition
              characterized by atypical binding and involuntary color photisms.
              Phosphene thresholds negatively correlated with glutamate
              concentrations in visual cortex, with lower thresholds associated
              with elevated glutamate. This relationship was robust, present in

              implicated in virtually all brain functions. Although they can be
              described by a prominent peak in the power spectrum, their
              waveform is not necessarily sinusoidal and shows rather complex
              morphology. Both frequency and temporal descriptions of such
              non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations can be utilized. However, in
              non-invasive EEG/MEG recordings the waveform of oscillations
              often takes a sinusoidal shape which in turn leads to a rather
              oversimplified view on oscillatory processes. In this study, we
              show in simulations how spatial synchronization can mask
              non-sinusoidal features of the underlying rhythmic neuronal
              processes. Consequently, the degree of non-sinusoidality can
              serve as a measure of spatial synchronization. To confirm this
              empirically, we show that a mixture of EEG components is indeed
              associated with more sinusoidal oscillations compared to the
              waveform of oscillations in each constituent component. Using
              simulations, we also show that the spatial mixing of the
              non-sinusoidal neuronal signals strongly affects the amplitude
              ratio of the spectral harmonics constituting the waveform.
              Finally, our simulations show how spatial mixing can affect the
              strength and even the direction of the amplitude coupling between
              constituent neuronal harmonics at different frequencies.
              Validating these simulations, we also demonstrate these effects
              in real EEG recordings. Our findings have far reaching

              the benefit from this combination is twofold. Firstly,
              neuroimaging and electrophysiology can inform subsequent NTBS,
              providing the required information to optimize where, when, and

              electrophysiology can provide the readout for neural changes

              the stimulation and ``offline'' NTBS effects outlasting
              plasticity-inducing NTBS protocols can be assessed. Finally, both
              strategies can be combined to close the loop between measuring
              and modulating brain activity by means of closed-loop brain
              state-dependent NTBS. In this paper, we will provide a conceptual
              framework, emphasizing principal strategies and highlighting

              the alpha band, has been implicated in regulating excitability in
              visual areas as a function of anticipatory spatial attention.
              Here we asked whether temporal expectations derived from regular,
              rhythmic events can modulate ongoing oscillatory alpha-band
              activity, so that the changes in cortical excitability are
              focused over the time intervals at which target events are
              expected. The task we used involved making a perceptual
              discrimination about a small target stimulus that reappeared from
              ``behind'' a peripheral occluding band. Temporal expectations
              were manipulated by the regular, rhythmic versus irregular,
              arrhythmic approach of the stimulus toward the occluding band.
              Alpha-band activity was measured during the occlusion period, in
              which no stimulus was presented, but target reappearance was
              anticipated in conditions of high versus low temporal

              expectations. Alpha desynchronization increased rhythmically,
              peaking just before the expected reappearance of target times.
              Analysis of the event-related potentials evoked by the subsequent
              target stimuli showed enhancement of processing at both visual

              possible reasons that working memory performance improves with

              impression that working memory capacity reaches adult levels

              that unlikely explanation, I consider how infant studies may lead

              development of working memory during the school years is also

              connectivity and brain network topology, suggesting they have a
              role in flexibly reconfiguring brain networks in order to adapt
              behavior and cognition to environmental demands. To date,
              however, the relationship between brainstem arousal systems and
              functional connectivity has not been assessed within the context
              of a task with an established relationship between arousal and
              behavior, with most prior studies relying on incidental
              variations in arousal or pharmacological manipulation and static
              brain networks constructed over long periods of time. These
              factors have likely contributed to a heterogeneity of effects
              across studies. To address these issues, we took advantage of the
              association between LC-NE-linked arousal and exploration to probe
              the relationships between exploratory choice, arousal-as measured
              indirectly via pupil diameter-and brain network dynamics.
              Exploration in a bandit task was associated with a shift toward
              fewer, more weakly connected modules that were more segregated in

              Performance on a visual task is often better when target stimuli
              are presented near or at the fovea compared to the retinal
              periphery. For instance, reaction times and error rates are often
              reported to increase with increasing eccentricity. Such findings
              have been interpreted as purely visual, reflecting
              neurophysiological differences in central and peripheral vision,
              as well as attentional, reflecting a central bias in the
              allocation of attentional resources. Other findings indicate that
              in some cases, information from the periphery is preferentially
              processed. Specifically, it has been suggested that visual
              processing speed increases with increasing stimulus eccentricity,
              and that this positive correlation is reduced, but not
              eliminated, when the amount of cortex activated by a stimulus is
              kept constant by magnifying peripheral stimuli (Carrasco et al.,
              2003). In this study, we investigated effects of eccentricity on
              visual attentional capacity with and without magnification, using
              computational modeling based on Bundesen's (1990) theory of
              visual attention. Our results suggest a general decrease in
              attentional capacity with increasing stimulus eccentricity,
              irrespective of magnification. We discuss these results in
              relation to the physiology of the visual system, the use of
              different paradigms for investigating visual perception across
              the visual field, and the use of different stimulus materials

              This manuscript presents several new techniques that make MEA
              spike sorting more robust and accurate. Our pipeline is based on
              an efficient multi-stage ``triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit''
              approach that initially extracts only clean, high-quality
              waveforms from the electrophysiological time series by
              temporarily skipping noisy or ``collided'' events (representing
              two neurons firing synchronously). This is accomplished by
              developing a neural network detection and denoising method
              followed by efficient outlier triaging. The denoised spike
              waveforms are then used to infer the set of spike templates
              through nonparametric Bayesian clustering. We use a
              divide-and-conquer strategy to parallelize this clustering step.
              Finally, we recover collided waveforms with matching-pursuit
              deconvolution techniques, and perform further split-and-merge
              steps to estimate additional templates from the pool of recovered
              waveforms. We apply the new pipeline to data recorded in the
              primate retina, where high firing rates and highly-overlapping
              axonal units provide a challenging testbed for the deconvolution
              approach; in addition, the well-defined mosaic structure of
              receptive fields in this preparation provides a useful quality
              check on any spike sorting pipeline. We show that our pipeline

              threshold vision under optimal physiological conditions yield
              values between 2.1 and 5.7 x 10(-10) ergs at the cornea, which
              correspond to between 54 and 148 quanta of blue-green light. 2.
              These values are at the cornea. To yield physiologically
              significant data they must be corrected for corneal reflection,
              which is 4 per cent; for ocular media absorption, which is almost
              precisely 50 per cent; and for retinal transmission, which is at
              least 80 per cent. Retinal transmission is derived from previous
              direct measurements and from new comparisons between the
              percentage absorption spectrum of visual purple with the
              dim-vision luminosity function. With these three corrections, the
              range of 54 to 148 quanta at the cornea becomes as an upper limit
              5 to 14 quanta actually absorbed by the retinal rods. 3. This
              small number of quanta, in comparison with the large number of
              rods (500) involved, precludes any significant two quantum
              absorptions per rod, and means that in order to produce a visual
              effect, one quantum must be absorbed by each of 5 to 14 rods in
              the retina. 4. Because this number of individual events is so
              small, it may be derived from an independent statistical study of
              the relation between the intensity of a light flash and the
              frequency with which it is seen. Such experiments give values of
              5 to 8 for the number of critical events involved at the
              threshold of vision. Biological variation does not alter these
              numbers essentially, and the agreement between the values
              measured directly and those derived from statistical
              considerations is therefore significant. 5. The results clarify
              the nature of the fluctuations shown by an organism in response
              to a stimulus. The general assumption has been that the stimulus
              is constant and the organism variable. The present considerations
              show, however, that at the threshold it is the stimulus which is
              variable, and that the properties of its variation determine the

              mechanism thought to be important for protecting memories is the
              reactivation of neuronal activity patterns representing those
              memories. In artificial neural networks, such memory replay can

              with a five-layer encoder and a five-layer decoder to learn
              visual representations from a diverse set of unlabeled images.
              Using the trained VAE, we predicted and decoded cortical activity
              observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from
              three human subjects passively watching natural videos. Compared
              to CNN, VAE could predict the video-evoked cortical responses
              with comparable accuracy in early visual areas, but relatively
              lower accuracy in higher-order visual areas. The distinction
              between CNN and VAE in terms of encoding performance was
              primarily attributed to their different learning objectives,
              rather than their different model architecture or number of
